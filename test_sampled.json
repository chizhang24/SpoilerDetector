Mind you, there is the Allegrant series, but then again I feel that I am at that stage where I am going to pretty much ignore the final one in the series because, well, there is nothing all that different between that one and this one. Okay, this one was a little darker than the Allegrant series, though the Maze Runner movies were, I have to admit, somewhat better. Anyway, I'm not so much talking about those movies, but this one, in particular why they decided to split the final book into two. Well, I guess because Twilight and Harry Potter did it, so they probably should as well. Also, I'm glad that somebody bought the Hunger Games box set at the church fate because after watching these movies I would be regretting spending the money on it.Well, Peter has been rescued, but it turns out that they had been torturing him, and he isn't the Peter that Katnis once new. Well, the fact that he tried killing her at the end of the last movie does suggest that. So, somewhat upset at President John Snow (who as a bad guy, really doesn't come across all that well), Katnis decides to go and kill him, however Coin won't let her leave the compound due to her being too precious. Well, she sneaks out anyway, and through the use of surveillance Coin discovers this (tell be again how these rebels are any different). So, the old gang gets pack together for a final strike against the headquarters of John Snow (that name keeps on reminding me of the really cool Game of Thrones character \u0096 couldn't Collins have picked a different name).As it turns out (I've used this a lot in these reviews), the entire city has been booby trapped with bombs that explode in particular ways, and they have a holo generator that tells them where they are. Thus the movie has them pass one bomb, step into another wiping out half the party, and then getting caught up in a third one which wipes out all but a handful. Then they make a mad dash towards the citadel only to be caught up in a bombing raid.Anyway, all I can say about this film is that it was predictable \u0096 very, very predictable. In fact when it came to the end and Coin declared herself interim president or an indefinite period I simply rolled my eyes. Seriously, couldn't it have been a lot more dramatic. As for the ending, well, it just took forever to end. Seriously, it could have been much more effective, and much more dramatic than it really was. In fact, as I watch the film come to an end all I could say is that I'm not surprised that the film ended the way it did because, well, all the other endings were pretty horrible as well.","rating":3,"review_summary":"Finally, the pain is over","cleaned_review_text":"final ive got end seri go glad movi look forward mind allegr seri feel stage go pretti much ignor final one seri well noth differ one one okay one littl darker allegr seri though maze runner movi admit somewhat better anyway im much talk movi one particular decid split final book two well guess twilight harri potter probabl well also im glad somebodi bought hunger game box set church fate watch movi would regret spend money itwel peter rescu turn tortur isnt peter katni new well fact tri kill end last movi suggest somewhat upset presid john snow bad guy realli doesnt come across well katni decid go kill howev coin wont let leav compound due preciou well sneak anyway use surveil coin discov tell rebel differ old gang get pack togeth final strike headquart john snow name keep remind realli cool game throne charact couldnt collin pick differ namea turn ive use lot review entir citi boobi trap bomb explod particular way holo gener tell thu movi pass one bomb step anoth wipe half parti get caught third one wipe hand make mad dash toward citadel caught bomb raidanyway say film predict predict fact came end coin declar interim presid indefinit period simpli roll eye serious couldnt lot dramat end well took forev end serious could much effect much dramat realli fact watch film come end could say im surpris film end way well end pretti horribl well","label":1}
{"review_date":"15 September 2008","movie_id":"tt0887883","user_id":"ur1098460","is_spoiler":false,"review_text":"After their Oscar winning turn last year, The Coen Brothers are back with the new film, this time comedy\/crime\/spy story which is very funny, very dark, quite angry, at times surreal, always ironic and to put it simply a must see for any Coens' fan which means a fan of great movie making. Comparing to the last year's Oscar Winner, No Country for Old Men, their new film may seem much lighter and provides many laughs. But keep in mind, it is comedy: Coens' style and it means that not always the most likable characters get what they look for. As much as the film is funny, it actually paints very disturbing picture about stupidly, idiocy, incompetence, inability to see one step ahead of your actions that keep filling every aspect of our existence with dangerous speed. I loved it - from the very first scene to the end. I laughed a lot, enjoyed the dialogs and the acting. How could I not with the dream cast that include John Malkovich, Tilda Swinton, George Clooney, Francis McDormand, and very funny and deliciously clueless, Brad Pitt, and many familiar faces in the small cameos. George Clooney who has made three films with The Coens got the funniest scenes, and gave IMO one of his best performances. John Malkovich has got to come out of his semi-retirement and act more. His every appearance in the film as forced to quit his job, very angry CIA Analyst who then decided to write a memoir, was a blast. Tilda Swinton as an arrogant icy cold professional woman, and Frances MacDormand as Linda who would stop at nothing in order to \"re-invent herself\", both added to the film's multiple delights.This time, Coens' usual collaborator, Roger Deakins was not director of photography, instead, Emmanuel Lubezki, four times Oscar Nominee (for Children of Men, The New World, Sleepy Hollow, and A Little Princess) took care of camera-work. The film has very beautiful look to it, and I was happy to recognize some of my favorite places in Washington, DC and George Town.","rating":9,"review_summary":"The Coen Brothers don't make bad movies - they don't know how :)","cleaned_review_text":"oscar win turn last year coen brother back new film time comedycrimespi stori funni dark quit angri time surreal alway iron put simpli must see coen fan mean fan great movi make compar last year oscar winner countri old men new film may seem much lighter provid mani laugh keep mind comedi coen style mean alway likabl charact get look much film funni actual paint disturb pictur stupidli idioci incompet inabl see one step ahead action keep fill everi aspect exist danger speed love first scene end laugh lot enjoy dialog act could dream cast includ john malkovich tilda swinton georg clooney franci mcdormand funni delici clueless brad pitt mani familiar face small cameo georg clooney made three film coen got funniest scene gave imo one best perform john malkovich got come semiretir act everi appear film forc quit job angri cia analyst decid write memoir blast tilda swinton arrog ici cold profession woman franc macdormand linda would stop noth order reinvent ad film multipl delightsthi time coen usual collabor roger deakin director photographi instead emmanuel lubezki four time oscar nomine children men new world sleepi hollow littl princess took care camerawork film beauti look happi recogn favorit place washington dc georg town","label":0}

All I can see here is a multitude of bad reviews, for a really respectable and pretty damn cool movie. Yeah, I'll admit there are a few (by that I mean more than a few) plot holes and pointless things happening, as have been pointed out by many silly nit picky critics on these pages- but don't let spoil the film for you! Instead of seeing a plot hole and analysing the film for two-and-a-half hours, just sit back, watch it, AND ENJOY IT. I have to admit, I too am usually a film-analyser too, but in my opinion, the greatness of the film clearly outweighs the slight plot inaccuracies- just ignore them! Now secondly, compare it to Daniel Craig's other \"Bond\" movies. Casino Royale- I'll admit, there is a fair amount of action, the story was all right, however half the movie was taken up by the lengthy, \"action-packed\" poker playing sequence, and Daniel Craig being whipped in the balls. That was the only Bond film I ever fell asleep in. And that is not a lie. Then Quantum of Solace- it's just crazy... There's a load of random fights, then a crazy guy who is trying to steal water then gets chopped in the foot with a fire axe... Somehow, I preferred it to Casino Royale, but yeah, still not great. But now, Skyfall is now going back to proper Bond- it balances the right amount of full-throttle action, with seriousness and humorous cheesiness. And also, Bond actually says more than five lines in this film... In conclusion, it's got non-stop action, giant lizards, Chinese mobsters, gadgets (I admit not the best ones, but that's more than we can say for the last two films), bimbos randomly being shot, false teeth, meltey faces, impossible stunts, badass old men with sawn-off shot guns, traps AND the Aston Martin DB5..! WHAT MORE COULD YOU WANT?

In my opinion, the best songs are those with the operatic church-lithurgy choir mixed in with the whole, such as \"Hellfire,\" \"The Bells of Notre Dame,\" and the music accompanying the story throughout the whole film, such as in the scene where Quasimodo rescues Esmerelda from a fiery death near the end.The Broadway-worthy singing voices of Tom Hulce, Jay Alexander, and all the other characters are a refreshing breath of air as well as a surprise for the close celebrity-talent watching critic like me. I am still stunned that most of the singing voices are the actual actors themselves singing, and not a voice-over.What a beautiful celebration of Victor-Hugo's centuries-old masterpiece! I am very glad it was nominated for an Oscar for Best Musical Score, but I don't know for the life of me why it didn't win it, or why it wasn't nominated for \"Best Picture.\" In my book, it deserves every Oscar available.

{"review_date":"6 April 2005","movie_id":"tt0112471","user_id":"ur3051431","is_spoiler":false,"review_text":"Before Sunrise is one of those films you stumble across by accident, and it this unexpected confrontation with excellence that causes the audience to experience that shakabookoo moment; that Swift Spiritual Kick to the Head That Alters Your Reality Forever. Before Sunset is life, it is experience. Anyone that has ever met someone they \"kind of like\" and wanted to find out more about them will know what this film is about. This is missed opportunity, this is chance, this is the roll of the dice and the one that got away. In this film a guy meets a girl on a train, they talk about nonsense as is the norm, but instead of saying goodbye and obsessing about what might have been the guy takes the leap of faith and convinces the girl to spend the next 14 hours exploring Vienna with him. Already we see perfection; already this movie is a masterpiece. Is it Ethan Hawke's scruffy American backpacker Jesse that reels us in, or the sexy Celine played by Julie Delpy? I say \"played by\" but there is no \"play\" in this film, there is no performance or representation. In this film the actors achieve such a level that this is nothing other than the \"real\", the dialogue is of a couple exploring one another, the action is the terrified adolescent that hides in every adult, terrified of saying the wrong thing that may cause a loved one to disappear out of their life forever. The beauty of this enchanting film is how the actors communicate what is often unsaid, suggesting that they are about to say something, or make a joke, but think better of it. Vulnerable glances are exchanged; tentative gestures of affection are made. This is the truest representation of a couple meeting, and through conversation realising that they have met their soul mate, ever committed to film. It is heartbreaking to watch the impetuousness of youth dictate that the exchanging of phone numbers is a waste of time, for in youth we wrongly feel that their will be many that we connect with on such a spiritual level. The final moments of the film leave the audience perplexed, with an overwhelming desire to KNOW what happens next. It is a stroke of luck to come across this film after the sequel has been released, for to wait the nine years for Before Sunset to be released would be an exquisite form of torture. In the sequel we see the couple bump onto each other once more, and quite rightly we soon see that both carry scars from their original encounter. The memories of that one perfect night have been encased in crystal and romanticised, so that no future encounter would ever live up to that experience. There is but one option for these playthings of Cupid, they have to explore a complete relationship with one another. As each scene unfolds we look to our watch, counting down the time in which these obvious soul mates have to discover they are made for one another. Early on we feel safe, they are re-acquainting themselves with what once was, playing poker for lovers, in which cards are held close to their chest. But this cannot be maintained, and it is in Jesses company limo that we are truly dragged back into the narrative, fully committed to their relationship when Celine breaks down, screaming about the repercussions that evening had for her; when you have experienced that true connection with another person, everything else is dull in comparison. Again we check our watch, what will happen? Can we endure another departure as in Before Sunrise? The characters are now more mature and world weary; life is taking its toll. Now in their thirties they have an appreciation for each other that was lost in Venice. They have seen more of the world and realised no comparison can be made to that one night they shared together. Priorities are quickly re-arranged. What is life for? What is important? The sequel is snatched moments, fighting against a clock that continuously haunts them. Sometimes we scream for them to be truly honest with each other, to throw off their responsibilities and engulf themselves in their love, other times we fear that their lives will pull them apart, locked into an existence of wondering what could have been. The ending of Before Sunset is perfection, and should be held up as a pinnacle of film making. A scene that is so unexpected and yet so correct, that if your reaction is a cheer, a tear or a jeer, you will know in your heart that it was right, and sit looking at the screen analysing and exploring all of the \"what ifs?\" that the characters will now face. The true charm of the film is not what the characters are experiencing, but the level to which every viewer will project their own life onto the screen, contemplating whether they are with the right partner, or whether at some point in the past they should have spoke up, or allowed time for that special someone. The universal response on viewing this film will be a deep down, soul aching desire to watch yet another sequel in another nine years time. Any film that can haunt its audience in this way is deserving of its title of Masterpiece.","rating":10,"review_summary":"Before Sunset and Sunrise are Masterpieces and reviewed together here.","cleaned_review_text":"sunris one film stumbl across accid unexpect confront excel caus audienc experi shakabookoo moment swift spiritu kick head alter realiti forev sunset life experi anyon ever met someon kind like want find know film miss opportun chanc roll dice one got away film guy meet girl train talk nonsens norm instead say goodby obsess might guy take leap faith convinc girl spend next hour explor vienna alreadi see perfect alreadi movi masterpiec ethan hawk scruffi american backpack jess reel us sexi celin play juli delpi say play play film perform represent film actor achiev level noth real dialogu coupl explor one anoth action terrifi adolesc hide everi adult terrifi say wrong thing may caus love one disappear life forev beauti enchant film actor commun often unsaid suggest say someth make joke think better vulner glanc exchang tent gestur affect made truest represent coupl meet convers realis met soul mate ever commit film heartbreak watch impetu youth dictat exchang phone number wast time youth wrongli feel mani connect spiritu level final moment film leav audienc perplex overwhelm desir know happen next stroke luck come across film sequel releas wait nine year sunset releas would exquisit form tortur sequel see coupl bump onto quit rightli soon see carri scar origin encount memori one perfect night encas crystal romanticis futur encount would ever live experi one option playth cupid explor complet relationship one anoth scene unfold look watch count time obviou soul mate discov made one anoth earli feel safe reacquaint play poker lover card held close chest maintain jess compani limo truli drag back narr fulli commit relationship celin break scream repercuss even experienc true connect anoth person everyth els dull comparison check watch happen endur anoth departur sunris charact matur world weari life take toll thirti appreci lost venic seen world realis comparison made one night share togeth prioriti quickli rearrang life import sequel snatch moment fight clock continu haunt sometim scream truli honest throw respons engulf love time fear live pull apart lock exist wonder could end sunset perfect held pinnacl film make scene unexpect yet correct reaction cheer tear jeer know heart right sit look screen analys explor if charact face true charm film charact experienc level everi viewer project life onto screen contempl whether right partner whether point past spoke allow time special someon univers respons view film deep soul ach desir watch yet anoth sequel anoth nine year time film haunt audienc way deserv titl masterpiec","label":0}

Riding on the back of every caper cliche, it rises to no particular heights and will be a movie footnote by about the end of the month.The biggest problem is that \"The Italian Job\" possesses no imagination at all. I've seen it all before and done better then. The acting is fine  the cinematography is completely acceptable, but this film breaks absolutely no new ground.Let's tick off the cliches: - \"old-school\" criminal father figure and his protege - another gang member jealous of protege - a double-cross - only bad guys use guns while good-guy criminals don't have to - good criminals always outwit the bad guysAnd that's about the first fifteen minutes. Everything is so predictable. Even the heist and car chase scenes, supposedly the highlight of the movie, seem pretty ordinary. This is especially true since they appeared in the trailers for the film so I already knew what to look for.For me, a caper film works only if it has an element of realism - that maybe, just maybe, it could be pulled off without relying on a deux ex machina or \"just because\" moments. Parts of \"The Italian Job\" just throws that out the window, with computers doing things that computers can't do, the good guys not hitting anyone with their driving (especially going down the stairs) and not one single police car responding to street explosions, recklessly driven minis or even a low flying helicopter. Must be a heck of a city for these things not to rate a response.The acting is passable, with the crew (Seth Green, Jason Stratham and Mos Def) being at least fun to watch. Mark Wahlberg is just too smarmy as the \"nice guy\" hero while Charlize Theron is about the only actor called on to display some kind of range. Donald Sutherland is a class act as always and shows up Wahlberg's deficiencies every moment they are together.Overall this is a pretty uninteresting film. Given the IMDb ratings, it's the girls that really love this film, which I can understand to some extent, but there are such better caper films out there - even the vapidness of the recent \"Ocean's Eleven\" outshines the non-event that is \"The Italian Job\".\n***SPOILER***At the conclusion, take a moment to think about what is going to happen to Norton's character. Are we meant to be cheering the good guys for causing his demise, especially since it would appear to be long and painful?

It deserves it's accolades, but I have to say, it's tough picture to watch at times. The whipping scenes in particular are extremely brutal, and just as in \"The Passion of the Christ\", I have to wonder if any person's human body can stand up to that type of torture. It's too graphic even for words, and rending another person's flesh as depicted seems almost incomprehensible.Which is the point I guess. The brutality of slavery is on display here in all it's horror, and in today's politically charged climate, this makes for exceptional Oscar fodder. Too bad it were not otherwise. The film could probably win on it's own merits without the politics of the Academy involved, and if it does win Best Picture, who will know for sure? Of course this all a few hours before the fact, so in a little while I guess all the guessing games can begin.As well as the picture itself, Chiwetel Ejiofor and Lupita Nyong'o are solid contenders for their respective categories. The scene where Patsey begs Solomon to end her misery was a standout for me, and spoke to the unbearable circumstances so often associated with slavery and it's horrors.

However, the script seemed very rushed. The action was good along with some humor thrown in, but it seems like they should have left certain things out or expanded upon them more instead of just trying to put a little bit of the whole story in there.

There isn't a moment in this movie where the director, actors, writer or the musical score let you forget it. Sadly, it a very poor epic. The dialog is pretentious posturing and war-mongering. Many times in the movie, our great, god-like hero, Brad Pitt, speaks and the crowd cheers. Utter garbage.There are wholly implausible moments in a movie that is attempting a very realistic presentation. There is a scene where Brad Pitt lops the head off a gold-plated, stone (or perhaps solid gold) statue like it was made of butter. This can work in a movie that is a fantasy or supernatural epic, but it was inconsistent with the timbre of this movie.The acting from very good actors is consistently bad. I like Brad Pitt. He is an exceptionally talented actor (just see \"12 Monkeys\" for proof of that). This movie made him look like a pretty-boy B movie actor, which he worked so hard to avoid early in his career.The director of this movie, Wolfgang Peterson, has to take the blame for this. He failed to execute on a very good, well-known story. Even the score of this movie was pompous and intrusive. There is nothing redeeming about this movie.

I'm not a fan of all of the superhero genre, people ask me why- and no it's not that I don't like it because it's a comic book at all, but it's just that the films tend to be just CGI filled, and lack any interesting atmosphere. I won't even talk about characters here.So, unlike those films, Mad Max: Fury Road does it all right, instead of CGI-filled action sequences we have ACTUAL stunts, this obviously, whether if consciously or unconsciously make the action look far better, also, unlike all those other modern action movies, we actually KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING, it's not just focusing on character each time and basically confusing us and not showing the entire battlefield so it may have the feel it is an actual fight- sequence, no, this film actually makes us know constantly what's on our back, sides and front.Of course I need to also address the unique post-apocalyptic atmosphere in this film, the music also fits rather perfectly. The ways those apocalyptic people fight with strange gadgets on top of their vehicles is also very entertaining to watch.So, I would definitely recommend this film, it is no Citizen Kane, I mean it isn't something deep- nor it should be, in fact I would say this is what a summer blockbuster should be- it may be not very philosophical or heart warming, but it is very entertaining and a lot of fun- and even memorable!

Yet, the latter 1\/2 of the movie is filled with long, long scenes of Baby.... RUNNING?!?Then, add on all the lost potential - You can easily sing away to the ending song of FF7, but here in Baby Driver, you can barely put together a La La Land-like soundtrack. It's a total scramble of odd songs from across genres that don't really fit together - more like the ramblings of the director's mind - and what you get is nothing that reaches as high as the very first bank robbery scene, which setup lots of anticipation for it's timed wipers, etc.Tack on paper-thin characterization - the assembled 'team' is barely interesting versus the FF team. Unmotivated and silly scenes.eg. Right, you go into a building to get weapons, hear a super long blab about port cuts, and only get offered 9 weapons?! And instead of picking the 'best', Jamie starts a shootout, picks up random weapons, and blows the rest up?!? So -stupid- versus FF, where the team is offered the best, and they build and take the best to offer the audience a truly awesome race\/fight scene later on. In Baby, it's an aborted effort. Why offer the goods if you're just going to waste it all?eg. So many scenes are merely Talk, Talk, Talk, Talk.... all in the MIDDLE of an exciting fight\/chase\/etc. scene. Why, oh, why wasn't all this cut?? And you end up with a miserable ending versus the 'enemy' at the end. Baby steals one car, crashes it into the bad guy's car. Then, Baby gets out, steals another in the parking lot, crashes it again into the bad guy's car. Then, gets out.... you get the idea. Just how fast can one kid get out of a car, break into another, jack it, and drive it into the bad guy?! So unbelievable.... not only for the changing of cars, but now it's become \"Baby Car Crash\" rather than \"Baby Driver\".Spacey dies in an equally lame way in the end - simply shot dead. Not even uses the full potential of Baby here at all, who stands with his girl looking all stupid at the men coming to shoot him dead instead of 'Running' so well like he did earlier in the movie. Why, Baby, Why don't you RUN???? Because it's not a Driver movie anymore and you're facing death. The movie does stick with you afterwards and you do wonder, what if the fullest potential of the idea had been written into the movie? Imagine if it had Top 10 hits, rocking cameos by top singers, FF-style car chases, an amazing team fighting to escape the cops, etc. Yes, it would have broken Wonder Woman records and become a cult legend. Instead, Baby Driver slowly deflates after the first bank robbery and leaves everyone with a yawn at the end for the immature ending. (It's also unbelievable how the the girl is characterized - every girl I've talked to who watched it rolls her eyes at the unbelievable way she 'falls in love' all so suddenly.)You're also left with the tapes. Such unbelievable potential, wasted. It could have had Spacey listen to the 'Mom' tape, setting up the reason he protects Baby in the end and his life changes, realizing the 'love' he once had, but nope. Nothing done with it that would have moved the viewers. 7\/10 because it's unique enough to stick in your brain for a day or two after. Otherwise, I'd rank it lower for the fragmented plot, weak characterization of most of the characters, poor pacing, etc.","rating":7,"review_summary":"Trailer showcases high potential, wasted in the actual film","cleaned_review_text":"spoiler spoiler spoiler spoilersth trailer held great potenti movi smartli time move energet music explos car chase scene bud romanceth actual movi worth one discount movi ticket view theater mostwhyy start catchi titl babi driver youd think youll see fast furiousstyl chase throughout like trailer teas yet latter movi fill long long scene babi runningthen add lost potenti easili sing away end song ff babi driver bare put togeth la la landlik soundtrack total scrambl odd song across genr dont realli fit togeth like rambl director mind get noth reach high first bank robberi scene setup lot anticip time wiper etctack paperthin character assembl team bare interest versu ff team unmotiv silli sceneseg right go build get weapon hear super long blab port cut get offer weapon instead pick best jami start shootout pick random weapon blow rest stupid versu ff team offer best build take best offer audienc truli awesom racefight scene later babi abort effort offer good your go wast alleg mani scene mere talk talk talk talk middl excit fightchaseetc scene oh wasnt cut end miser end versu enemi end babi steal one car crash bad guy car babi get steal anoth park lot crash bad guy car get get idea fast one kid get car break anoth jack drive bad guy unbeliev chang car becom babi car crash rather babi driverspacey die equal lame way end simpli shot dead even use full potenti babi stand girl look stupid men come shoot dead instead run well like earlier movi babi dont run driver movi anymor your face death movi stick afterward wonder fullest potenti idea written movi imagin top hit rock cameo top singer ffstyle car chase amaz team fight escap cop etc ye would broken wonder woman record becom cult legend instead babi driver slowli deflat first bank robberi leav everyon yawn end immatur end also unbeliev girl character everi girl ive talk watch roll eye unbeliev way fall love suddenlyyour also left tape unbeliev potenti wast could spacey listen mom tape set reason protect babi end life chang realiz love nope noth done would move viewer uniqu enough stick brain day two otherwis id rank lower fragment plot weak character charact poor pace etc","label":1}

The new Blu-ray is one of the best releases from 2014 by Second sight, featuring a stunning new transfer (better than a depressing number of all- time classics), and a hugely enjoyable new making-of documentary. Fans in the US may be disappointed the disc is locked to Region B, but anyone with a compatible player who enjoys the movie should not hesitate to pick up a copy. Highly recommended.Rocky Morton and Annabelle Jankel's Dinohattan doesn't stray too far from dystopias like Blade Runner (in fact, production designer David L. Snyder worked on both films), but there's something infectious about seeing filmmakers allowed to reinvent source material with such wild abandon. The Goombas are no longer mushrooms but gigantic lizard men decked out in burgundy war regalia. Snyder embraces the industrial look of the film's real-life shooting locale with metal walkways, dangling power cords, and neon lighting curling around gray concrete pillars. Even the Koopahari desert is filled with strange, anonymous men in hazmat-style suits driving \"sludge tankers\" filled with garbage bags. All of these settings are also draped in the fungus, a string-cheese-like substance that occasionally offers power-ups to the heroes, including the iconic Bob-omb. A fun score by Alan Silvestri adds another layer of cohesion. The Super Mario Bros. movie is a good adaptation of the video game, it has a darker grittier slant than the game which.works better, good movie, it's certainly a memorable one, an ambitious failure that's far more inventive and interesting than 10 more faithful failed video game adaptation.","rating":10,"review_summary":"it's hard to deny that the film is so bizarre, it was primed for cult status from the get-go.","cleaned_review_text":"hard deni film bizarr prime cult statu getgo new bluray one best releas second sight featur stun new transfer better depress number time classic huge enjoy new makingof documentari fan us may disappoint disc lock region b anyon compat player enjoy movi hesit pick copi highli recommendedrocki morton annabel jankel dinohattan doesnt stray far dystopia like blade runner fact product design david l snyder work film there someth infecti see filmmak allow reinvent sourc materi wild abandon goomba longer mushroom gigant lizard men deck burgundi war regalia snyder embrac industri look film reallif shoot local metal walkway dangl power cord neon light curl around gray concret pillar even koopahari desert fill strang anonym men hazmatstyl suit drive sludg tanker fill garbag bag set also drape fungu stringcheeselik substanc occasion offer powerup hero includ icon bobomb fun score alan silvestri add anoth layer cohes super mario bro movi good adapt video game darker grittier slant game whichwork better good movi certainli memor one ambiti failur that far invent interest faith fail video game adapt","label":0}

More importantly, how do you pay homage to the original without alienating new moviegoers? \"Evil Dead,\" the remake of the 1981 cult-classic, succeeds...more or less.The opening is a departure from the main story-line and the original \"Evil Dead,\" creating a great atmosphere and introducing a little but of the grizzly gore that Sam Raimi revolutionized. And I was hooked! But from there it goes down hill, then up again, then down and up the rest of the way.The people coming to this movie don't care about the story because they go to this for the experience. To feel they should not be watching what is on screen before them. To feel uncomfortable. But director and writer Fede Alvarez adds some none the less. Sure, it helps to flesh out a few characters more, adding a little bit of depth. But once hell starts to break loose, it really doesn't matter all that much. That was one thing that really worked better in the original. Sam Raimi did not spend nearly as much time developing a story this time because it was not necessary. You are here to be grossed out, so why bother starting a story that is never meant to be finished? Yet in this extended storytelling, Alvarez develops the mythology behind the bloody events to come. While not nearly as creepy as the voice recording from the original, it adds to the film. This is where the development really works.Once that half-hour-ish chunk is out of the way, blood starts pouring. Choosing a practical approach to these effects help this film a lot, creating a more believable and brutal character to the violence. But when all was said and done, I felt empty. The marketing campaign is both the triumph and fall of this film. I remember cringing as I watched each red-band trailer, getting me more and more excited to watch the rare good installment in the horror genre that comes by only so often. But as the film progresses, I realized that they spoiled much of the what should have been disgusting surprises of the film. Believe me, there are some pretty disgusting moments in this film that were great, but I had already seen them several times from the trailers. I kept wanting something new to appear, but nothing really did. I strongly recommend staying away from watching the red band trailers if you want to save your reaction for the full cinematic experience.Many reviewers have criticized this remake for a lack of humor that defined the original. I would disagree and say that there is plenty of humor here, it is just not as campy as the original. I had myself nearly spitting at some of the profanities the Deadites utter. That's not to say that they are shocking, but are loads of fun. But that being said, I still wanted more from this film. Personally, I did not find the gore to be as cringe-worthy as others have described. Of course, that may be due to my multiple viewings of the red-band trailers, but I still could have seen it going farther. There were far too many jump scares for my taste, and I found myself not to be nearly creeped out as I could have been. I will say though that the end was by far the strongest part of the film, playing up the right elements of gore, suspense, and plain-old ass-kicking. I was happy to leave the theater with with that moment, saying to myself, \"That was pretty bad- ass.\"So is it worth the price of admission? I have come to the conclusion that the answer is yes. Admittedly I was disappointed in this film, but only because my expectations and exposure to the material was extremely high. Of course it is not as good as the original, which was funnier and creepier at the same time. Despite its faults, it still is a great time at the movies, especially in this spring slump. You will be cringing at what you see, asking yourself \"should I be seeing this?\" Yes, yes you should.","rating":8,"review_summary":"A Good Time Nonetheless","cleaned_review_text":"stand age hollywood use sequel prequel remak reimagin reliabl crutch importantli pay homag origin without alien new moviego evil dead remak cultclass succeedsmor lessth open departur main storylin origin evil dead creat great atmospher introduc littl grizzli gore sam raimi revolution hook goe hill rest wayth peopl come movi dont care stori go experi feel watch screen feel uncomfort director writer fede alvarez add none less sure help flesh charact ad littl bit depth hell start break loos realli doesnt matter much one thing realli work better origin sam raimi spend nearli much time develop stori time necessari gross bother start stori never meant finish yet extend storytel alvarez develop mytholog behind bloodi event come nearli creepi voic record origin add film develop realli worksonc halfhourish chunk way blood start pour choos practic approach effect help film lot creat believ brutal charact violenc said done felt empti market campaign triumph fall film rememb cring watch redband trailer get excit watch rare good instal horror genr come often film progress realiz spoil much disgust surpris film believ pretti disgust moment film great alreadi seen sever time trailer kept want someth new appear noth realli strongli recommend stay away watch red band trailer want save reaction full cinemat experiencemani review critic remak lack humor defin origin would disagre say plenti humor campi origin nearli spit profan deadit utter that say shock load fun said still want film person find gore cringeworthi other describ cours may due multipl view redband trailer still could seen go farther far mani jump scare tast found nearli creep could say though end far strongest part film play right element gore suspens plainold asskick happi leav theater moment say pretti bad assso worth price admiss come conclus answer ye admittedli disappoint film expect exposur materi extrem high cours good origin funnier creepier time despit fault still great time movi especi spring slump cring see ask see ye ye","label":0}

Here is my take on this movie (SPOILERS): Brad Pitt plays a psychotic tank platoon sergeant who kills an unarmed, clearly surrendering POW to teach a new tank crew member \"how to kill\". No officers or senior NCOs make any effort to stop him. His company commander next gives him an important mission for his tank platoon. On this mission, thru poor crew discipline, poor road march discipline, and very bad tank tactics ends up getting his entire platoon wiped out. If you look closely, this movie is just a very cynical version of \"Saving Private Ryan\" with some \"Cross of Iron\" thrown in. It reminds me of those \"Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos\" comic books of the 60's, and the end is very similar to the \"Ghost Tank\" story lines in that comic book. In fact, I suspect strongly that this scrip started out as a film script version of that comic book. The vast majority of the real members of the 2nd Armored Division were not psychopaths, and by April 1945 they had very good discipline and knowledge of tank tactics. Despite the hype, this is another case of Hollywood WW II, not the real one.

It may be the studio's least immediate film, but it grows with time thanks to what amounts to a kind of minimalism. It's less flashy and bombastic that any other cartoon feature I can remember; its dramatic peak arrives with the placement of a rock on the ground.The SEVEN SAMURAI-inspired story couldn't be farther from the Andrew Lloyd Webberish monotony of the trite Disney features that have arrived in the last few years. A BUG'S LIFE dares to be intricate and unsentimental (a welcome characteristic in most of the Pixar features), and it becomes a sweeping epic with some light but cutting humor and a sense of journey that should make repeat viewings a treat even for the parents forced to sit through it over and over.What's more, the voice acting is terrific, with an excellent performance by David Foley and a no-holds-barred, terrifying turn from Kevin Spacey, who is far closer to his SE7EN character than to K-PAX world in this G-rated film. I haven't even mentioned the animation, which in a world of fast-moving technical advancement at this studio and everywhere still looks astounding seven years later.All the Pixar movies are surprising, but A BUG'S LIFE has a creative spark that completely blindsides the viewer. The plotty bits can drag slightly, especially those involving the circus crew, usually far less interesting than the lead character and villain, but no matter. These vivid characters and an absorbing story make for almost peerless entertainment.","rating":9,"review_summary":"the real beginning of something","cleaned_review_text":"saw bug life alreadi becom fan five pixar struck profound sophist subtleti sheer complex storytel may studio least immedi film grow time thank amount kind minim less flashi bombast cartoon featur rememb dramat peak arriv placement rock groundth seven samuraiinspir stori couldnt farther andrew lloyd webberish monotoni trite disney featur arriv last year bug life dare intric unsentiment welcom characterist pixar featur becom sweep epic light cut humor sens journey make repeat view treat even parent forc sit overwhat voic act terrif excel perform david foley noholdsbar terrifi turn kevin spacey far closer seen charact kpax world grate film havent even mention anim world fastmov technic advanc studio everywher still look astound seven year lateral pixar movi surpris bug life creativ spark complet blindsid viewer plotti bit drag slightli especi involv circu crew usual far less interest lead charact villain matter vivid charact absorb stori make almost peerless entertain","label":0}

You genuinely care about the characters and what happens to them, mostly. The special effects are also good.BUT, in the past... I dunno... I guess ten years maybe? The movie industry has gotten so damn brooding and depressing! Every time I watch a movie like this one, it nearly ALWAYS ends in tragedy! What the hell ever happened to the hero prevailing (even if its by a small margin) in the end, and teaching people to fight for survival and maybe you'll come out alive in the end with your loved ones at your side? I'm getting tired of this crap, its getting old and I for one am totally sick of it.An abundance of tragedies where all the characters you care about die in the end and\/or the hero is doomed to a lifetime of everlasting sorrow and depression, is a fad. I get it. But I don't want to see it anymore, its depressing! Why is everyone so damn melancholy and brooding?! I've had enough to last me a life time. PLEASE someone bring back the traditional hero who wins in the end and saves his family and friends! But you know, make them work harder for it. Don't make it easy on them. ;) I'd also like to mention, I loved the message in this movie about how dangerous and destructive religion is and how when the world falls apart, those who are very religious are always the first to go nuts, cause violence, and make matters worse for those who are just trying to survive and keep their families safe. Religion preys on those of weak character\/intelligence and paranoid, and this movie really shined a light on that. For that I give it an extra point.In summery, the movie gets good points all around for all the important stuff, but this movie falls into the fad of depressing tragedies that is turning me off from movies of this genre all together, so that takes off about 3 points from the 8 I originally was giving it.

One thing they did with this film which I loved, was they spent a large chunk focusing on the origin of villains in the most interesting way.

{"review_date":"4 July 2010","movie_id":"tt0435761","user_id":"ur22268559","is_spoiler":false,"review_text":"Pixar, it seems, have seriously become a force to reckon with. It all started with Toy Story in 1995 and since then, they've consecutively delivered masterpieces after another as if to virtually remove all doubt that Toy Story was a fluke (and no, it wasn't one). The next in line is Toy Story 3 which, quite easily, joins the ranks of Pixar's finest movies (though I'm now struggling to recollect which one wasn't).In Toy Story 3, we see that Andy is about to move to college. He has to pack up his toys in the attic, donate them, or trash them (that's the choices he has). While he decides to go to the first option, the toys, through a series of misadventures land up in Sunnyside - a place where they'll have plenty of kids to play with them. But all is not as well as it seems since the kids are far from what Andy was when he played with the toys - they thrash them, mercilessly pound them and mess the toys up - enough to make the toys decide to go home.The best thing about Pixar movies (despite the fact that they're animated movies) has been the characters - something which other movie makers need to learn. Although Toy Story 3 excels in almost every department, the characters are never lost in the background. We still care about the likes of Woody, Buzz and Jessie which is surprising considering that we know they're just pieces of toys. And the voice acting is just incredible. I thought Tom Hanks would have lost his form after all these years and was wondering whether, despite aging 10 years, he'd be able to voice Woody with the same enthusiasm he did back in the previous two Toy Story movies. However, he does a brilliant job at it and so does the rest of the voice cast. It'll make you feel as if the voice recording for the movie was done 10 years ago.Technically, the film features CGI which is amazingly impressive. There are times when you simply forget that this is an animation movie you're watching. In fact, just like in WALL\u00b7E, the only times the CGI looks CGI is when humans show up (which is perfectly understandable given that it's incredibly difficult to make human CGI). Watch the opening sequence to get what I say, it alone is enough to convince anyone of the visual superiority of this movie. Cinematography and Editing are also flawless, the movie never slows down and it feels that there's something constantly happening in the movie. Humor is again good - especially the scene in which Buzz turns into Spanish mode. Hilarious !!Just like it's predecessors, the most amazing feat of Toy Story 3 according to me is how it makes you emotional and sad towards it's end. It's a perfect example of directorial triumph. And this happens at a time when the characters in the movie just exchange glances at each other, they don't even speak much in that portion of the movie. It's strange to realize you'd become sad by just looking at toys without they saying anything. Without revealing anything all I can say is that the first thing you're likely to do after watching this movie is go home and check out your old toys. You're surely going to miss them - at least I did.My only gripes with the movie - I'd have loved to see more of Rex, Hamm and Slinky Dog. Rex's lack of confidence is something which came across as wonderfully in the first two movies. That is something that I missed. Also, the humor is less stronger as compared to the first two movies and so are the dialogues. Those are my thoughts. These tiny nitpicks shouldn't deter anyone from watching this movie. And yes, the 3D was simply pointless. I actually wanted to watch the movie in 2D but couldn't since all major movie screens are showing it in 3D. That made it clear that the 3D was more for the purposes of generating revenue than for anything else.And yes, it's time we accepted that these movies are NOT movies for Kids. They can be enjoyed equally by Adults as well - in fact more so. It's high time people stopped slamming these movies as movies for the kids and skipped them. If you're one of them, you're missing out on something really important here - something you'll regret 10 years from now for sure.

But maybe I'm too old or too discriminating, 'cause TRANSFORMERS is without a doubt the WORST film I've sat through all year long.

What's worse is that most people couldn't see through what a completely lazy, talentless and unimaginative movie this really is.

{"review_date":"5 June 2013","movie_id":"tt1408101","user_id":"ur32651879","is_spoiler":false,"review_text":"Star Trek: Into Darkness is the sequel to the overrated Stark Trek reboot from 2009. It's about how the Enterprise is sent on a mission to kill a terrorist who's been causing havoc in the city of London.To be honest, I wasn't even planning on seeing this movie in theaters. But the critics praised it, calling it the best movie of the year so far. Skeptical as I was, I still gave it a chance.Before I start rambling about Into Darkness, let's talk about the previous film. The previous film was a good movie with some likable characters and a good set-up. What it lacked, however, was a compelling story and an interesting villain.Is Star Trek: Into Darkness an improvement over the original? Hell yeah it is! This is hands down the best movie of the year so far! I was worried it'd be the same as The Dark Knight craze; fanboys blinded by the overly serious plot, but Star Trek: Into Darkness has enough humor to make it fun and enough drama to make you care about the characters.The writing in this movie is ten times better than the original. It's a lot faster-paced than the first movie, and the plot is actually interesting. On the surface, it's a very simple good vs. evil plot. But it's the characters that make this movie truly interesting. There's a lot more energy here than there was in the previous movie, and that makes the whole thing much more entertaining.Probably the biggest improvement from the first movie is the villain. I won't spoil too much about this guy. All I'm gonna say is he is so good. Sometimes he's a bit too over-the-top, but the moral dilemma he brings up makes him a believable villain, and not just some bad guy who does bad things.The main characters are much better this time around. Chris Pine as Kirk I've always liked, and he's just as good, if not better in this movie. Spock was a whiny and unlikable jerk in the first movie, but in this one he's a much better character who develops over-time. The rest of the characters have also seen improvements, and are all much more likable.Overall, Star Trek: Into Darkness is a great movie. If you're a filmmaker looking for inspiration to make a sequel, this is one of the movies you should take notes from. I'm not necessarily calling it one of the best sequels ever, but I am calling it one of the most improved sequels ever. If you are a Star Trek fan, chances are you'll LOVE this movie to death. And even if you aren't one, like me, you'll still probably find it very enjoyable.","rating":8,"review_summary":"Finally Stark Trek Has a Soul!","cleaned_review_text":"star trek dark sequel overr stark trek reboot enterpris sent mission kill terrorist who caus havoc citi londonto honest wasnt even plan see movi theater critic prais call best movi year far skeptic still gave chancebefor start rambl dark let talk previou film previou film good movi likabl charact good setup lack howev compel stori interest villaini star trek dark improv origin hell yeah hand best movi year far worri itd dark knight craze fanboy blind overli seriou plot star trek dark enough humor make fun enough drama make care charactersth write movi ten time better origin lot fasterpac first movi plot actual interest surfac simpl good vs evil plot charact make movi truli interest there lot energi previou movi make whole thing much entertainingprob biggest improv first movi villain wont spoil much guy im gon na say good sometim he bit overthetop moral dilemma bring make believ villain bad guy bad thingsth main charact much better time around chri pine kirk ive alway like he good better movi spock whini unlik jerk first movi one he much better charact develop overtim rest charact also seen improv much likableoveral star trek dark great movi your filmmak look inspir make sequel one movi take note im necessarili call one best sequel ever call one improv sequel ever star trek fan chanc youll love movi death even arent one like youll still probabl find enjoy","label":0}
{"review_date":"22 December 2017","movie_id":"tt0119738","user_id":"ur4234119","is_spoiler":false,"review_text":"In the AFI Romance's montage, the image of a smiling Julia Roberts running in the airport was inserted in the 'climactic races' part, when you know it was only to meet her friend, you have an idea of how misleading the image was (although that was quite a bump when they 'met'). That's the best thing about P.J. Hogan's \"My Best Friend's Wedding\", it toys with all the expectations and actually delivers a story where you never exactly know what will happen till the end. That it stars Julia Roberts could be seen as its best asset, but even in her finest romantic comedies, say \"Pretty Woman\" or \"Notting Hill\", let's not kid ourselves, we knew exactly how they would end. In \"My Best Friend's Wedding\", we sort of figure out that she's not going to win, but the certitude doesn't come up immediately and still, there's the whole mystery about how the revelations will all unfold and the hurts be done with each characters' arc closing in a satisfying way. This is a love triangle and a school case of intelligent screen writing. The credit goes to Ronald Bass and I'm pretty sure a few more one-liners would have sealed its chances for an Oscar nomination.Now, take the set-up, we all know it but it's a delightful one. Food critic Julianne Potter (Roberts) gets a phone call from her best friend Michael O'Neal (Dermot Mulroney). Together they forged a pact that if no one found true love at 28, they were going to marry each other, the call almost rings like a proposal, except that the proposal was done and Michael is getting married with Kimmy Wallace (Camerone Diaz) a 20-year dizzy girl from a very wealthy Chicago family. Julianne is flabbergasted, her poor Michael has obviously fallen in a trap, or is just too blind to realize he's doing the blunder of his life. Naturally, she decides to sabotage the wedding.Once the pieces of the game are placed, you've got to wonder who's got the most thankless role. Is it Julia Roberts because she's the closest to an unsung villain and there's never a moment where we empathize with her or accept any of her plans to ruin the idyll between the couple to be. Or is it Cameron Diaz whose performance as Kimmy resembles her smiling and overly naive Mary in the Farrelly Brothers' film and she looks like the eternal victim too dumb (or enamored) to realize that she just asked her worst enemy to be her maid of honor. Or is it Michael who doesn't see what's going on and has literally jeopardized his happiness without realizing it? In a lesser script, the film would have been cringe-worthy or mean-spirited.But this is a quality screenplay. As a matter of fact, none of these characters have a thankless role, Julianne is given her moments of redemption, but they're never played as \"what have I done?\" but rather \"what am I doing?\" she does question herself but it strikes that she genuinely loves Michael and she's acting out of selfishness more than meanness. I liked that she really sticks to her original plans until she realizes it's definitely over. Michael isn't just the good looking playboy playing hide-and-seek with his feelings, Mulroney plays him as a rather articulate man who's also unsure about his feelings and do have a few demons to get rid of, with both Julianne or Kimmy. In a way, even Julianne's plans allows him to settle some records.As for Kimmy, she may not be the brightest bulb but she's given her finest moment at the climactic confrontation and again, the film doesn't go for the cheap, easy and spectacular way. In another movie (Anne 'cough' Hatthaway, Kate 'cough, cough' Hudson), there would have been a big cat-fight with parts of the wedding cake being thrown at the guests, but this film plays in another league, the whole thing is dealt in an adult, and funny way that makes us reconsider our initial anticipations. That's how a film should work, surprising, heart-warming and fun. Ronald Bass' screenplay made me realize why I disliked screwball movies like \"His Girl Friday\" or \"The Philadelphia Story\", if \"My Best Friend's Wedding\" was a George Cukor's film, it would have probably ended with Julia Robert's plans working all the way.But it's played perfectly in the film, because the characters are all three-dimensional and sympathetic. But if none of them have thankless roles, the juiciest role belongs to the scene-stealing Rupert Everett who plays Robert's gay friend, George Downes, an editor who knows what to say, who handles his identity with very good charm and spirit and who's responsible for possibly the three best parts of the film. His unforgettable introduction to Kimmy with all the frenetic laughs and one hilarious slap in the butt that I suspect was unscripted, the signature scene where everyone sings \"A Little Prayer for You\" and naturally, the ending, you can't make a good romantic comedy without a nice ending. And I couldn't think of a better way to close it.Speaking of Rupert Everett, this was an Oscar nomination performance because that's exactly what supporting performances are supposed to be, they enhance the appeal of the film with a limited screen presence, it's a role that plays like a Greek chorus, a comic relief and a voice of wisdom all in once. And it's not every guy who can't take pride from stealing the thunder of Miss Julie Roberts herself...So, \"My Best Friend's Wedding\" is one of these experiences that slowly grows on you and you end up realizing twenty years after that there have been a very few romantic comedies as good or better as \"My Best Friend's Wedding\". Julia Roberts will turn 50 soon and the film reminds us what a gem for romantic comedies (or so-called chick flicks) she was.","rating":8,"review_summary":"Chic Flick!","cleaned_review_text":"afi romanc montag imag smile julia robert run airport insert climact race part know meet friend idea mislead imag although quit bump met that best thing pj hogan best friend wed toy expect actual deliv stori never exactli know happen till end star julia robert could seen best asset even finest romant comedi say pretti woman not hill let kid knew exactli would end best friend wed sort figur she go win certitud doesnt come immedi still there whole mysteri revel unfold hurt done charact arc close satisfi way love triangl school case intellig screen write credit goe ronald bass im pretti sure onelin would seal chanc oscar nominationnow take setup know delight one food critic juliann potter robert get phone call best friend michael oneal dermot mulroney togeth forg pact one found true love go marri call almost ring like propos except propos done michael get marri kimmi wallac cameron diaz year dizzi girl wealthi chicago famili juliann flabbergast poor michael obvious fallen trap blind realiz he blunder life natur decid sabotag weddingonc piec game place youv got wonder who got thankless role julia robert she closest unsung villain there never moment empath accept plan ruin idyl coupl cameron diaz whose perform kimmi resembl smile overli naiv mari farrelli brother film look like etern victim dumb enamor realiz ask worst enemi maid honor michael doesnt see what go liter jeopard happi without realiz lesser script film would cringeworthi meanspiritedbut qualiti screenplay matter fact none charact thankless role juliann given moment redempt theyr never play done rather question strike genuin love michael she act selfish mean like realli stick origin plan realiz definit michael isnt good look playboy play hideandseek feel mulroney play rather articul man who also unsur feel demon get rid juliann kimmi way even juliann plan allow settl recordsa kimmi may brightest bulb she given finest moment climact confront film doesnt go cheap easi spectacular way anoth movi ann cough hatthaway kate cough cough hudson would big catfight part wed cake thrown guest film play anoth leagu whole thing dealt adult funni way make us reconsid initi anticip that film work surpris heartwarm fun ronald bass screenplay made realiz dislik screwbal movi like girl friday philadelphia stori best friend wed georg cukor film would probabl end julia robert plan work waybut play perfectli film charact threedimension sympathet none thankless role juiciest role belong scenest rupert everett play robert gay friend georg down editor know say handl ident good charm spirit who respons possibl three best part film unforgett introduct kimmi frenet laugh one hilari slap butt suspect unscript signatur scene everyon sing littl prayer natur end cant make good romant comedi without nice end couldnt think better way close itspeak rupert everett oscar nomin perform that exactli support perform suppos enhanc appeal film limit screen presenc role play like greek choru comic relief voic wisdom everi guy cant take pride steal thunder miss juli robert herselfso best friend wed one experi slowli grow end realiz twenti year romant comedi good better best friend wed julia robert turn soon film remind us gem romant comedi socal chick flick","label":0}

The H8 is a 168 min long movie which is described as a sort of mystery thriller and a lot a noise was made (mainly by Quentin himself) when the script leaked early and therefore would harm the box office chances of this flick. The movie did indeed not make big waves money wise but that was mainly because the overly long movie does actually not amount to much story wise. In other words there is no real clue. The dialogue, normally the strongpoint of Tarantino films, is actually not that great. Conversations are drawn out without the characters actually saying anything. It does help a lot that we do get a great cast (Kurt Russel, Sam L Jackson and Jennifer Jason Leigh) because without them the movie would fall apart rather quickly. The film was shot on 2,76:1 70mm widescreen because retro elitist Tarantino thinks digital isn't good enough and I do have to say the snowy landscape shots look awesome but they make up only 2% of the flick. The rest of it is in a cabin where standard 35mm or even a digital camera could have perfectly captured the images. About the music I can be short: there is almost none. It' might have been composed by Moricone who unrightfully got an Oscar for it, but it does not add much here in this film. I'm glad I didn't see it on the big screen. It works just as well on the small screen, maybe even better coz you can pauze it to get more booze and a snack.

Oh well! Then you must be sorry to witness this movie. The humor was a mess and the plot and dialogues were too slow and yes you guessed it, this movie again mourned for the death of Superman for almost 15 minutes! Come on you already mourned for him for 30 minutes in the last movie.There's no character developer, no touching verses and nothing that would make the movie worth a watch.For Aquaman and Batman fans, \"Sorry to say that it's such a worst time for you to live in this planet\". Batman was nothing but a pathetic human whose incapable of doing anything, even driving a plane or car or whatever. It's more like this Batman didn't even had a working brain of a normal human with poor planning skills. He's just plain stupid, and Aquaman does nothing but discouraging others, a frightened guy and a dude who can't even fight properly underwater but just jumps here and there on air sometimes. There was a good tension building up towards climax only to be ruined completely making it a joke. * WARNING SPOILER ALERT:*Long story short: Announcing everyone that Superman is dead, showing how hopeless this world is without Superman and how everyone is trying to cope up without Superman, villain sees death of Superman as an opportunity and invades the world that's without Superman, Other dummy heroes tries to fight and fails pathetically, Batman plans to resurrect Superman but ridiculed and even beaten up by his teammates for that. However they resurrect him he then beats everyone (and only just throws Batman off but Batsy takes up a heavy damage, OH POOR BATSY) and flies away. While every other dummy heroes tries their best to fight off Steppenwolf (Batman does nothing by the way, he's more like a supporting cast during this fight) when all hope is lost Superman comes and saves the day without a sweat.

{"review_date":"21 December 2011","movie_id":"tt1568346","user_id":"ur29871011","is_spoiler":false,"review_text":"When I first read this book I found it slow going and long. Even after reading half of it I didn't like the confusion or the slow pace. At 3\/4 I began to like it and by the time I finished it had grown on me. Although not a well written book it was filled with detail that a movie maker could use to craft what they wanted into the picture. When I saw the Swedish film I was really impressed. It was a little confusing but much better than the book. The photography was interesting and bright and helped to let the viewer focus on the complex plot. The acting was really good and it was surprising that none of the characters were particularly attractive. I expected the English version to be much less realistic and it was but that's OK. We imagine ourselves as the characters and are used to Hollywood. The shocking scenes of nudity, homosexuality, rape, sadism, bondage and torture are brutal and I'm not sure if this isn't the most shocking to the sensibilities of any movie I've seen in my life. It stays with you long after you watch it and doesn't make me want to go visit Sweden anytime soon. I'll never think of it as the land of Elke Summer again. On the plus side I was really amazed at the quality of acting, photography, editing and overall movie-making in the Swedish film. It's not just at the top of foreign films it is comparable to any non special effect American movie. The American version I expected to be even better. I thought it would show the superior expertise of writers here portraying the complex plot in a more understandable manner. I thought there would be more effort shown with the pace of the movie and all the areas that we excel in because of the huge sums of money we put into our films. After all they were copying not only a best selling book but the most successful movie ever made in Sweden. How could it help but be better. Unfortunately I was wrong on all counts. This should have been a piece of cake. They weren't working from a book but already had a very good movie to work from. It seems like the worst they could do was just dub it in English and reap millions. Instead they started with a Terminator beginning like a James Bond movie, completely out of place and inexplicable. Then they get a director of dark, scary movies to create a dark mood with DARK visuals to make everything hard to see and understand. Sure don't need that with a complex plot. The music seemed out of place also. You don't need all this scary stuff when the story is absolutely frightening without it and when the contrast of bright clarity and horrible actions is much more shocking. A word about the characters. Daniel Craig looks a lot like the Swedish actor Michael Nyqvist except without the bad skin. Both were very good actors. The Girl Lizbeth (Noomi Rapace) was excellent. Going in everyone knew this was an Academy Award part besides being a three film role. What actress wouldn't want this role? And Mara Rooney also did a great job EXCEPT - now maybe I'm just getting old but they had her whisper stuff and mumble things and I absolutely couldn't hear or understand them. In a movie that has such incredible suspense you don't want to be asking the person next to you in the theater what the hell she said.Don't get me wrong. I like this movie. It was frightening. It was shocking. It was consequently REALLY memorable. But what an opportunity lost. I can't imagine how it could be easier to make a movie when all you have to do is copy a great one, make it in English, and improve on the weak points. Unfortunately it's sort of like they remade Pride and Prejudice with John Woo directing, and used rap music. The movie is a \"B\" that will get treated as an \"A\" because of the subject matter of abuse of women and how graphic the scenes of sexual abuse are. Rooney will receive awards, etc. But oh, what it could have been. If you like this movie, which you will, get the Swedish version. You'll like it better.","rating":8,"review_summary":"Very good but couldn't touch the Swedish version.","cleaned_review_text":"first read book found slow go long even read half didnt like confus slow pace began like time finish grown although well written book fill detail movi maker could use craft want pictur saw swedish film realli impress littl confus much better book photographi interest bright help let viewer focu complex plot act realli good surpris none charact particularli attract expect english version much less realist that ok imagin charact use hollywood shock scene nuditi homosexu rape sadism bondag tortur brutal im sure isnt shock sensibl movi ive seen life stay long watch doesnt make want go visit sweden anytim soon ill never think land elk summer plu side realli amaz qualiti act photographi edit overal moviemak swedish film top foreign film compar non special effect american movi american version expect even better thought would show superior expertis writer portray complex plot understand manner thought would effort shown pace movi area excel huge sum money put film copi best sell book success movi ever made sweden could help better unfortun wrong count piec cake werent work book alreadi good movi work seem like worst could dub english reap million instead start termin begin like jame bond movi complet place inexplic get director dark scari movi creat dark mood dark visual make everyth hard see understand sure dont need complex plot music seem place also dont need scari stuff stori absolut frighten without contrast bright clariti horribl action much shock word charact daniel craig look lot like swedish actor michael nyqvist except without bad skin good actor girl lizbeth noomi rapac excel go everyon knew academi award part besid three film role actress wouldnt want role mara rooney also great job except mayb im get old whisper stuff mumbl thing absolut couldnt hear understand movi incred suspens dont want ask person next theater hell saiddont get wrong like movi frighten shock consequ realli memor opportun lost cant imagin could easier make movi copi great one make english improv weak point unfortun sort like remad pride prejudic john woo direct use rap music movi b get treat subject matter abus women graphic scene sexual abus rooney receiv award etc oh could like movi get swedish version youll like better","label":0}

{"review_date":"3 June 2016","movie_id":"tt2101441","user_id":"ur65972856","is_spoiler":false,"review_text":"\"Spring Breakers\" stars James Franco, Selena Gomez, Vanessa Hudgens, Ashley Benson, and Rachel Korine. The film is directed by Harmony Korine, who brought us \"Gummo\" (1997), and \"Trash Humpers\" (2009). The film is about these four girls in college who are planning on going on Spring break but due to money issues they are unable to go. The only solution these girls have is by robbing a diner, which they do. Once on Spring break they party, drink, and do drugs. One day they are arrested for possession of drugs\/doing drugs. They are bailed out by Alien, who is a rapper, drug hustler, and arms dealer. Alien takes the girls under his wing to show them what Spring break is all about. I'll be honest I was very surprised with this film, it was better than I'd expected. Harmony Korine is one of the most stylized and original directors in the film industry, the only thing is that all of his films receive average to negative reviews. With \"Spring Breakers\" he finally landed a film with enough positive criticism so he can finally be seen and heard. \"Spring Breakers\" targets the youth of today's society, social media, art, and most of all Spring break. The very first minute of the film demonstrates what's later to come throughout the duration of this movie. The opening of this movie is a bunch of young men and women partying, and drinking on a beach. The thing that mostly affected me were what the people were doing and the way they were presented, they acted like barbaric animals, it definitely demonstrated what Spring break is all about within just one minute. James Franco gives the best performance of his entire career so far in this film, I'm very surprised he did not get an Oscar nomination for his transformative role as this gross and disgusting human being. The film looks beautiful, if you love neon lighting this movie is for you. This movie should've been called \"Neon Porn\" instead. Throughout the film you wonder what more trouble are these girls going to get into next and it just keeps getting worse. This film demonstrates very poor decision making from the younger generation. But hey, they want to party and do tons of illegal activities! Who can blame them!? (Being sarcastic). A couple of issues I have with the film is that it has a lot of female nudity. Now I have nothing against the female body but I felt that it was just a distraction from the film's story and heavily exploited women . Now if I was twelve years old and saw this film I wouldn't have had a problem with it. The film is very repetitive with its dialogue, the characters will say the same thing multiple times, and it gets very distracting. The first 20 or 30 minutes are pretty slow, and you're left waiting for when the film is ready to pick up. Once James Franco is on the screen the film is solid throughout. One thing that I do like about this film is that it has a lot of literary devices in it. You have a lot of imagery, and foreshadowing. I didn't think this film would be so literary but it was and it surprised me a lot. Overall \"Spring Breakers\" is a solid film by Harmony Korine, and demonstrates an interesting story about Spring break and all the things that can possibly go wrong with it. One thing I must point out is that this is a drama. For those of you who are looking for the next \"American Pie\" (1999), you're not going to find it with \"Spring Breakers\". Now if you don't like artsy films you will most likely not like this movie because it is very very artsy. Check out \"Spring Breakers\", it is better than what most people say it is, but hey I have my opinions and you have yours so see it if you want.","rating":8,"review_summary":"Look at my s***!","cleaned_review_text":"spring breaker star jame franco selena gomez vanessa hudgen ashley benson rachel korin film direct harmoni korin brought us gummo trash humper film four girl colleg plan go spring break due money issu unabl go solut girl rob diner spring break parti drink drug one day arrest possess drugsdo drug bail alien rapper drug hustler arm dealer alien take girl wing show spring break ill honest surpris film better id expect harmoni korin one styliz origin director film industri thing film receiv averag neg review spring breaker final land film enough posit critic final seen heard spring breaker target youth today societi social media art spring break first minut film demonstr what later come throughout durat movi open movi bunch young men women parti drink beach thing mostli affect peopl way present act like barbar anim definit demonstr spring break within one minut jame franco give best perform entir career far film im surpris get oscar nomin transform role gross disgust human film look beauti love neon light movi movi shouldv call neon porn instead throughout film wonder troubl girl go get next keep get wors film demonstr poor decis make younger gener hey want parti ton illeg activ blame sarcast coupl issu film lot femal nuditi noth femal bodi felt distract film stori heavili exploit women twelv year old saw film wouldnt problem film repetit dialogu charact say thing multipl time get distract first minut pretti slow your left wait film readi pick jame franco screen film solid throughout one thing like film lot literari devic lot imageri foreshadow didnt think film would literari surpris lot overal spring breaker solid film harmoni korin demonstr interest stori spring break thing possibl go wrong one thing must point drama look next american pie your go find spring breaker dont like artsi film like like movi artsi check spring breaker better peopl say hey opinion see want","label":0}

Also I believe there are a lot of good reviews of this film out there that should be read. Shocking, disturbing, brutal...those are just a few words that can describe this movie. What a human being can do for revenge, or just to find answers is unbelievable. I always ask myself how an actor could play so good in a movie where emotions are taken on a different kind of level. This is a movie that makes you feel disgusted with the world and ashamed of what humans can do to each other. It is a horror film that even for gorehounds the stomach may go nuts. A lot of people are making jokes when watching a horror film, trying to make it easier to watch. The moment Anna gets captured nobody can laugh anymore, it is intense and brutal. A normal person could not even think of making a joke at that moment. This movie depicts what human nature is capable of and makes it sad. The movie starts with a horror story and then walks into another one, over and over again. The actors did an amazing job, made it feel a lot more realistic with genuine emotions. Morjana Alaoui pulls in a heart wrenching performance. This is another reason why this movie is so good. I read that a lot of people were repulsed by the second part of the movie and it is understandable, but then again, it is just a movie (clearly not made for those with a weak heart). I still don't understand the world we live in, but I think these are realistic events converted in a fictional environment. The ending went into a direction I was not expecting. Like all horror films, the main character is either saved, either killed. But in this one the director gave a more profound meaning to the whole film. He left us surrounded by mystery and everyone can have their own interpretation. It is original, unlike a significant number of modern horror movies.

I cried many times, in both joy and sorrow, as the story unfolded. The first viewing I shall never forget. The 10th viewing I shall never forget, even better than the first 9 viewings!Humble Danielle (Cinderella) tries to set everything straight with the prince, attempting to explain that she is a mere peasant girl commoner, and not of royal blood. But the prince loves her so much, he never gives her a chance to confess. Then when the time comes for the confession, it is the wrong time! Her confession is turned aside to her destruction and grief at the grand costume ball. She comes into the scene of the resplendent mask ball festivity, dressed as the most noble and beautiful creature imaginable, with gorgeous white gown and gossamer angel wings, to the rapturous thrill of the Prince, the Queen, and the King. The Prince is love-struck. But two or three minutes later, after her true identity is revealed by her heartless step mother who reveals everything, Danielle (Cinderella) leaves the scene humiliated and in tears, with wings clipped (literally one wing torn off), losing her glass slipper on the way, as she runs to escape from the Prince and depart the royal costume ball, a totally humiliated peasant girl dashing into the cold dark night of a fierce rainstorm. She ends up soaking wet and grief stricken, wearing one glass slipper and one broken angel's wing, sobbing uncontrollably in a tattered wedding gown that is filthy and ruined, weeping in the soaking rain, while thunder and lightning are roaring all around her.Oh my, oh my!

Henry-esquire tale of innocence paying a blood debt for incalculable evil, \"The Boy in the Striped Pajamas\" is nonetheless a minor Holocaust film worth at least a viewing. Adapted for film and helmed by British director, Mark \"Brassed Off\" Herman, from an Irish novel for young adults, \"The Boy...\" tells the story of a stunningly naive German boy, Bruno, who befriends a Jewish peer, an inmate of the concentration camp run by Bruno's father, an SS officer. Themes of trust, friendship, and willing complicity in evil doings are explored as things move toward a somewhat telegraphed and highly unlikely conclusion.Beyond nicely realized performances by the \"name\" actors headlining the cast--Vera \"The Orphan\" Farmiga, David \"Harry Potter and...\" Thewlis, and Rupert \"The Young Victoria\" Friend--the real leads, children both, are quite effective, which is good, because the success of the film truly rests on their chemistry. Asa \"Son of Rambow\" Butterfield and newcomer Jack Scanlon draw the viewer into their unusual relationship and tragic adventure with effortless grace; they could both well be young actors worth keeping tabs on. No, there's no complaint in the acting, nor in most of the relatively low-budget production values. Shot in Hungary, \"The Boy...\" manages a nice period veneer on an otherwise most improbable dramatic hook, line, and sinker. The film suffers from plotting anomalies and some far-fetched dramatic assumptions.I'll be blunt: the young son of an SS officer in WWII Germany simply could not have been as sheltered and ingenuous as the film's protagonist; it beggars willing suspension of disbelief, or at least it does mine. And the scenario of two little boys on opposite sides of a barbed wire fence surrounding a concentration camp, though emotionally and visually arresting, borders on the definition of preposterous. Perhaps this is all explained away in the source novel; perhaps not. The film makes no attempt, and perhaps purposefully so. For me, it didn't work.As I said, though, still worth a watch if you're in the mood for that sort of overt manipulation. The ending is almost \"Twilight Zone\"-ish in its melodramatic tragedy, and left this viewer feeling that he'd been cheated of a resolution more in keeping with the prior tone and perspective of the story.","rating":6,"review_summary":"Well-meaning but dubiously probable...","cleaned_review_text":"henryesquir tale innoc pay blood debt incalcul evil boy stripe pajama nonetheless minor holocaust film worth least view adapt film helm british director mark brass herman irish novel young adult boy tell stori stunningli naiv german boy bruno befriend jewish peer inmat concentr camp run bruno father ss offic theme trust friendship will complic evil do explor thing move toward somewhat telegraph highli unlik conclusionbeyond nice realiz perform name actor headlin castvera orphan farmiga david harri potter thewli rupert young victoria friendth real lead children quit effect good success film truli rest chemistri asa son rambow butterfield newcom jack scanlon draw viewer unusu relationship tragic adventur effortless grace could well young actor worth keep tab there complaint act rel lowbudget product valu shot hungari boy manag nice period veneer otherwis improb dramat hook line sinker film suffer plot anomali farfetch dramat assumptionsil blunt young son ss offic wwii germani simpli could shelter ingenu film protagonist beggar will suspens disbelief least mine scenario two littl boy opposit side barb wire fenc surround concentr camp though emot visual arrest border definit preposter perhap explain away sourc novel perhap film make attempt perhap purpos didnt worka said though still worth watch your mood sort overt manipul end almost twilight zoneish melodramat tragedi left viewer feel hed cheat resolut keep prior tone perspect stori","label":1}

{"review_date":"18 April 2016","movie_id":"tt3774694","user_id":"ur26136649","is_spoiler":true,"review_text":"Through his raw and often disturbing approach to cinema, Gaspar No\u00e9 continues to demonstrate himself to be one of the most innovative directors of today. I am quite fond of The Butcher trilogy (Carne, I Stand Alone, and Irreversible) as well as what I consider to be his magnum opus, Enter the Void. Frankly, Love is not as great as those other films mentioned, but is still quite good in its own right, and offers a lot more under its surface than one may expect or notice.No\u00e9 once said \"there is no line between art and pornography. You can make art of anything . . . Anything that is shot or reproduced in an unusual way is considered artistic or experimental.\" With this belief in mind, explicit filmed sexual content can be art, but that does not necessarily make it good art. Good art in my opinion, often raises comments or questions on something in life or philosophy, whether it is in its context or its subtext. Love, I think, is good art, through its creative and experimental approach in film making and the commentary and questions it raises.The film on the surface, is an erotic melodrama with easy-to-hate characters and an abundance of explicit sex scenes. However, I strongly believe this is all intentional on the behalf of No\u00e9, as he offers commentary and visual insight inside the intimacy of a sexual charged relationship.It should be NO\u00c9 surprise that the film's commentary is on sex and its effects on a relationship and the individuals. The film was released in 3D, allowing the audience to view the couple in their most intimate state as close to the viewer's eyes as possible, whether they'd like to or not. The sex scenes are mostly honest as they are neither simulated nor rehearsed. The opening shot acts as a thesis for the film to come, as two naked characters engage in a sexual act; the film going straight into the \"action.\" The film is told non-chronologically as Murphy, the young cinephilic protagonist and wannabe film-maker, looks back at his past relationship with Electra that ended due to unfaithfulness that lead him to having an unplanned child and staying with the mother, whom he grew to detest. Told through flashbacks, the story unfolds revealing more details about his sexually charged relationship with the emotionally unstable Electra. Most of the explicit sex scenes, once properly examined, appear to not be shown to arouse the viewer, but rather demonstrate the joy and pleasures of sex, and the importance sex can be within a relationship. Interestingly in more quick and less explicit nature, sex is also shown throughout the film in a more negative context, or leading to negative consequences when Murphy is shown cheating on Electra. I would argue that the film showcases that sex is meant to be between two people alone but presents the opposite side of the argument as well before refuting it. Murphy feels he must own Electra, going as far as to defend his manhood and his possession (Electra) by smashing glass against another man's head who appears as a threat to him and his relationship. Infidelity and excessive experimentation leads to tension and heartache within the relationship. The long sensual threesome scene fulfills both Murphy and Electra's sexual fantasy, but ultimately leads to Murphy having sex with the other woman again in secret and accidentally creating a child. This forever ruins his trust with Electra, all due to sex corrupting his mind.Murphy, throughout the film is a regular man corrupted by sex. To be frank, he is a jerk. Almost every conflict arises from the characters giving into unhealthy sexual temptation and then facing the consequences of it. Murphy faces the consequences of his actions and begins to regret and fall into depression, especially after hearing Electra had gone missing. He never meets up with her again, she remains in the past, only for him to further take responsibility. He looks back at his relationship and while most of it was in fact sexually excessive to an unstable and unhealthy degree, he truly loved Electra on an emotional level. Their mutual emotional bonding can be demonstrated in a flashback in which the two simply talk and stroll a park. The audience never learns the final whereabouts and fate of Electra's character, which I believe works well for the film. She is in the past, Murphy must take action and become a man. His biggest regret is not having a child with her. The film seems to argue that the objectively greatest thing about sex is the fact it can lead to another's birth. Two people create another. He made a baby, who he admittedly loves, with a woman who he doesn't. Murphy realizes he had never experienced the greatest thing love could had offered between him an Electra, the miracle of birth.","rating":9,"review_summary":"Love, actually","cleaned_review_text":"raw often disturb approach cinema gaspar continu demonstr one innov director today quit fond butcher trilog carn stand alon irrevers well consid magnum opu enter void frankli love great film mention still quit good right offer lot surfac one may expect noticeno said line art pornographi make art anyth anyth shot reproduc unusu way consid artist experiment belief mind explicit film sexual content art necessarili make good art good art opinion often rais comment question someth life philosophi whether context subtext love think good art creativ experiment approach film make commentari question raisesth film surfac erot melodrama easytoh charact abund explicit sex scene howev strongli believ intent behalf offer commentari visual insight insid intimaci sexual charg relationshipit surpris film commentari sex effect relationship individu film releas allow audienc view coupl intim state close viewer eye possibl whether theyd like sex scene mostli honest neither simul rehears open shot act thesi film come two nake charact engag sexual act film go straight action film told nonchronolog murphi young cinephil protagonist wannab filmmak look back past relationship electra end due unfaith lead unplan child stay mother grew detest told flashback stori unfold reveal detail sexual charg relationship emot unstabl electra explicit sex scene properli examin appear shown arous viewer rather demonstr joy pleasur sex import sex within relationship interestingli quick less explicit natur sex also shown throughout film neg context lead neg consequ murphi shown cheat electra would argu film showcas sex meant two peopl alon present opposit side argument well refut murphi feel must electra go far defend manhood possess electra smash glass anoth man head appear threat relationship infidel excess experiment lead tension heartach within relationship long sensual threesom scene fulfil murphi electra sexual fantasi ultim lead murphi sex woman secret accident creat child forev ruin trust electra due sex corrupt mindmurphi throughout film regular man corrupt sex frank jerk almost everi conflict aris charact give unhealthi sexual temptat face consequ murphi face consequ action begin regret fall depress especi hear electra gone miss never meet remain past take respons look back relationship fact sexual excess unstabl unhealthi degre truli love electra emot level mutual emot bond demonstr flashback two simpli talk stroll park audienc never learn final whereabout fate electra charact believ work well film past murphi must take action becom man biggest regret child film seem argu object greatest thing sex fact lead anoth birth two peopl creat anoth made babi admittedli love woman doesnt murphi realiz never experienc greatest thing love could offer electra miracl birth","label":1}

For me it was the highlight of the festival and i absolutely loved it but I don't believe it's a movie that anybody will truly 'enjoy'.As others have already given away too much of the story i won't bother with a synopsis as Martyr's is definitely a dish best served cold. Not knowing what to expect makes this a refreshingly shocking piece of celluloid that will hopefully astound you with it's gutsy originality. Written by the director during a fit of depression (that he did not elaborate on in the Q&A) it is an almost schizophrenic movie with two distinct halves and coda of such ambiguity that it is possible to view it as nihilistic or strangely hopeful. It's beautifully shot, really well paced and contains outstanding performances from the two female leads.This movie is inevitably going to be compared to Hostel and other movies in the horribly monickered 'torture-porn' genre and that is a genuine mistake. Martyrs bears more resemblance to movies like Nacho Cerda's Aftermath as there is nothing here that is designed to be titillating. The true horror lies in the the clinical detachment of the antagonists. In the end, despite all the on screen violence (and there are some truly brutal scenes on display here in the movies second act) the prevaling reaction that this movie elicited in me was not one of revulsion but one of true sadness. Martyrs really is a truly brilliant, surprisingly moving film and one that will remain in my mind, jostling for attention with my other thoughts for a very long time to come.

Previous film versions of the Exodus story (such as Cecil B. DeMille's 'The Ten Commandments') have been so much better, so why this dreadful remake was even considered is beyond me. It is Hollywood at its worst \u0097 at times ridiculously over-dramatised, at others just plain boring, and a severe distortion of the biblical account. In the scene about the burning bush, for instance, instead of Moses kneeling awestruck at the incredible sight as the majestic voice of God calls out from the bush, he is depicted as lying submerged in mud (on Mount Sinai?) while God appears as a young boy. The pathetic way the plagues are portrayed is ridiculous, and the details of the Passover are so minimal that I must have dozed off for half a minute and missed it.

The characterization is reminiscent of a simpler time in film, when body language was paramount and physical comedy dominated. Pixar made an emotional film about two robots that are barely vocal. A love story set against a backdrop with its own strong, relevant message. Not only that, the animation is done to near perfection. Focusing on atmosphere and lighting as if a live-action feature, WALL\u0095E has a powerful subliminal effect. Changing color schemes over time is a common technique, but desired results are seldom so realized. The accomplishments here took an unfathomable amount of finesse. It's truly awe-inspiring.

No humor or fun names like \"Hufflepuff\" or \"Floo Powder.\" The only whimsical things about this are wands, fantastic beasts, and the suitcase. Along with it being so lacking and a far cry from the wonderful Harry Potter world, it was across seas from Harry Potter, in America. Even though I live in the USA, I prefer Hogwarts any day. I liked the 1920s setting, but why in New York City instead of a great castle in the UK?! In addition, it was super confusing; if you missed one word, you'd miss everything. There was an unnecessary, weird, and dumb mating scene in the middle. Now don't get me wrong--there were some things I liked, such as the funny ending scene, the animation, the bad guy being a great surprise, and especially the main character! Newt was very likable! It was also great how this is named after one of the books Harry needs to get for his first year at Hogwarts. (Newt is planning on writing it.)So, in the end, though we have a great main character and incredible animation, the confusing plot and lack of Harry Potter ruins it.

My main problem is that the movie wants to be somewhat epic, but the story just seemed so arbitrary. It's a hard war with stupid Germans and mythical non-human SS. They get orders to take some town, then have a forced dinner party with some gentle raping (she likes it), then they have to go and save some people we never see or care about. (this is a MOVIE, we can't just be told this) The other tanks get destroyed by a (again) stupid German tank, who refuses to use his advantage, the long range gun. Run head on, you fanatical arrogant nazi \u00fcbermensch! Nobody is afraid of dying here, non-humans as they are. They survive, drive on, and soon is immobilized by a mine on some road somewhere. Here, on this dirt road, after no build-up or reason we as an audience can feel, they suddenly want to commit a heroic defense\/suicide. Because Americans are really tough when it comes to a good cause? They felt so awfully invested in human rights and freedom, killing, laughing, pillaging and raping all the way. The have fought many years, but on this dirt-road, they plan to make a last stance? 'Oh, right, it was a sentence somewhere about someone needing to be defended..?'. I mean, realistically, would a ww2 tank commander expect to stop a force of several hundred SS with panzerfausts, with a limp tank? Oh, it's a good cause, and then they can beat all odds, audiences love inspiring messages. If you believe..! And then a predictable boring battle ensues, with the crew dying as heroes for 'our freedom', killing faceless hordes of stunt-men playing evil Germans who can't use the anti-tank weapons they all carry. With this kill-ratio, they should have only needed some 50 tanks to destroy the entire German army. And I might add, always cast people who look bad or evil as the enemy, then we as audience feel it's okay. And that bumbling new crew-member, he went from scared, to traumatized (forced to shoot POW so he learns to kill and end the war faster?, i'd like to hear this logic applied in Iraq), then to really enjoying killing 'nazis', and in the evening, wanting to die with his dear tank commander. Really? Does he have Stockholm syndrome? Goldfish-memory?But war is hell, or something.. This was no Saving Ryan or BOB, just a expensive look-alike.

There's very little else to the story, which makes this film really powerful. With not much else other than a tedious walk and a vampish past the story bobs back and forth between the present and the past revealing how Cheryl finds herself in such a circumstance and why she cant stop until she is finished. At first Cheryl seems like a woman unable to let go of her now ex-husband, beginning a journey with more baggage than is necessary. It might almost be easy to throw this story into the bin of sappy chick-flicks when that inability to get closure on a relationships end is actually fronting as more of an act of remorse and regret. She messed up. And there is no way to repair the damage without an ugly scar.The further she goes the more she dives into the series of events that lead her to such a devastating circumstance of sex and drugs. The loss of her mother is far too much for her to feel. The depth of such pain can sometimes strip a human being from feeling anything at all. The tears flow from her face but those tears are not falling for grief, they drop from the overwhelming numbing the death has caused. Cheryl's emotions are lost in a wild and desolate space that is pain and grief, which is so perfectly mirrored with the vast, open landscape she is now physically wondering through. And both her emotions and the land are the same: it wont change immediately and things will be tough but if one keeps going forward one will come out of it. And better for it. Cheryl just needed that physical aspect to make the connection with her emotions. The self-loathing and destructive life she was living was the equivalence of her just lying down on the sandy path and dying right there. It's a fairly event-less film where a woman just goes through some fairly tough terrain but somehow the flashes to her past spliced in with the turmoil of her present moves the story along swimmingly.If you're a fan of deeply emotional story lines this one might very well be worth the watch.","rating":7,"review_summary":"Cheryl's emotions are lost in a wild and desolate space","cleaned_review_text":"arduou journey across america pacif crest trail cheryl stray test tenac continu forward till end there littl els stori make film realli power much els tediou walk vampish past stori bob back forth present past reveal cheryl find circumst cant stop finish first cheryl seem like woman unabl let go exhusband begin journey baggag necessari might almost easi throw stori bin sappi chickflick inabl get closur relationship end actual front act remors regret mess way repair damag without ugli scarth goe dive seri event lead devast circumst sex drug loss mother far much feel depth pain sometim strip human feel anyth tear flow face tear fall grief drop overwhelm numb death caus cheryl emot lost wild desol space pain grief perfectli mirror vast open landscap physic wonder emot land wont chang immedi thing tough one keep go forward one come better cheryl need physic aspect make connect emot selfloath destruct life live equival lie sandi path die right fairli eventless film woman goe fairli tough terrain somehow flash past splice turmoil present move stori along swimminglyif your fan deepli emot stori line one might well worth watch","label":0}

If anyone should ever wonder why the number of cinema-goers in Japan is dwindling, they would not have to go far to find out.

{"review_date":"5 July 2008","movie_id":"tt0100802","user_id":"ur13630333","is_spoiler":true,"review_text":"I've always been a HUGE Arnold Schwarzenegger fan, because in his prime in the 80s and early 90s, he made hugely profitable and entertaining movies. TOTAL RECALL (1990) is Arnie at his action (and perhaps even acting) peak. Total Recall may be the first movie of Schwarzenegger's that I realized, \"Darn! This guy ain't a bad actor!\". For you guys that think that Schwarzenegger can't act, watch this film. Actually, given the director, the great Paul Verhoeven, I should not have expected any less. He does an amazing job of taking larger-than-life beings, like Murphy in Robocop, and the superhuman Schwarzenegger in this film, and humanizing for all of us common folk. We actually relate to these powerful, yet sensitive, skewed, and damaged beings.Set sometime in the 'future',Total Recall tells the tale of Douglas Quaid (the aforementioned Schwarzenegger in a totally convincing performance). Quaid has a hot wife (Sharon Stone in her trademark super-sexy, conniving, backstabbing vixen role that she would become famous for in pretty much all her later films) and a seemingly content existence. But he has dreams of another life on Mars with an alluring brunette (will talk about her later). The bored Quaid wants some excitement in his life and so he goes to the company Rekall where they implant memories and visions of a completely different personality and existence. Quaid requests to be a secret agent on Mars with a sexy girlfriend, a la James Bond. During implantation, something goes terribly wrong and it appears that Quaid already has implants that the Rekall procedure has messed with. Turns out that Quaid has been to Mars and is a secret agent named Hauser put on Earth for a special mission, or so we think.When I first saw the film, I couldn't distinguish whether or not the stuff happening at Rekall was truly happening or were part of their implants to Quaid b\/c he DID request to be a secret agent on Mars with a sexy girlfriend. Ironic that he already had all that! That's part of the fun of the film: it keeps you guessing. And along the way, you get treated the classic Arnold puns and one-liners (got to have those). But in this film, Arnold actually shows some acting chops while he's delivering those pun-liners! He's really good.The film also boasts an impressive supporting cast: the aforementioned Stone, Ronny Cox (from Verhoeven's prior masterpiece Robocop), Michael Ironside as his #1 henchman (Ironside was also in Verhoeven's later Starship Troopers), and someone I've mentioned several times in this review, Rachel Ticotin as the dark-haired sexy girlfriend Melina, the one Quaid dreams about and requests at Rekall. Ticotin may just be the first (and last) Schwarzenegger female co-star that was his equal in terms of toughness and resourcefulness. Alluring is the word I used to describe her and that's what she is in this film: sexy without being overtly sexual, moderately attractive but still very desirable. It's easy to see what Quaid sees in her: she represents the excitement and danger that his humdrum daily existence lacks.Being a 'futuristic' film that came out in 1990, the film just barely escapes the dated look of 80s futuristic films. The look and feel of the film is believable enough to make you believe its the future, although some of the set pieces are a little humorous to take seriously now (the Johnny car?). But, all that aside, Total Recall is a great, thought-provoking action film with a complex premise and an all-time hero that everyone can root for: Arnold Schwarzenegger!","rating":10,"review_summary":"Fun-filled Verhoeven-Schwarzenegger pairing!","cleaned_review_text":"ive alway huge arnold schwarzenegg fan prime earli made huge profit entertain movi total recal arni action perhap even act peak total recal may first movi schwarzenegg realiz darn guy aint bad actor guy think schwarzenegg cant act watch film actual given director great paul verhoeven expect less amaz job take largerthanlif be like murphi robocop superhuman schwarzenegg film human us common folk actual relat power yet sensit skew damag beingsset sometim futuretot recal tell tale dougla quaid aforement schwarzenegg total convinc perform quaid hot wife sharon stone trademark supersexi conniv backstab vixen role would becom famou pretti much later film seemingli content exist dream anoth life mar allur brunett talk later bore quaid want excit life goe compani rekal implant memori vision complet differ person exist quaid request secret agent mar sexi girlfriend la jame bond implant someth goe terribl wrong appear quaid alreadi implant rekal procedur mess turn quaid mar secret agent name hauser put earth special mission thinkwhen first saw film couldnt distinguish whether stuff happen rekal truli happen part implant quaid bc request secret agent mar sexi girlfriend iron alreadi that part fun film keep guess along way get treat classic arnold pun onelin got film arnold actual show act chop he deliv punlin he realli goodth film also boast impress support cast aforement stone ronni cox verhoeven prior masterpiec robocop michael ironsid henchman ironsid also verhoeven later starship trooper someon ive mention sever time review rachel ticotin darkhair sexi girlfriend melina one quaid dream request rekal ticotin may first last schwarzenegg femal costar equal term tough resourc allur word use describ that film sexi without overtli sexual moder attract still desir easi see quaid see repres excit danger humdrum daili exist lacksb futurist film came film bare escap date look futurist film look feel film believ enough make believ futur although set piec littl humor take serious johnni car asid total recal great thoughtprovok action film complex premis alltim hero everyon root arnold schwarzenegg","label":1}

A real surprise considering ...Hello Barlington here , now as you can see from my title I've said considering now I've kept away from Percy Jackson for the mere fact it seemed like a Harry potter meets clash of the titans mix and I though it would end up being a cheap B-movie for teens with some CGI graphics , but amazingly it wasn't clich\u00e9 it had some adult humour for the masses and was surprisingly able to create good characters from relatively unknown main actors , who came probably from American television , From what I've heard it is part of a trilogy and so hope to see more of them really. Don't get me wrong it's not going to get nominated for any prizes but as it goes for a Fantasy movie got 0-25 it does it job. The story line being very simplistic really , very Chris Columbus in child content with a director who back in the day made some of m favourite movies has gone some of the way to regaining so dignity with this movie and moving away from too clich\u00e9 teen movies , but the story is basically boy has no dad , finds out he's a demi god and try's to save his mum with the help of his friends , that is simple enough but as I've said and will say in is the ensemble cast which makes this film worth watching really .Now the basics are out of its way the Greek mythology used was clear precise and utmost right not mentioning any names ... Clash of the titans..., The inclusion of strong supporting cast of Sean bean , Steve Coogan , Pierce Brosan , Uma Thurman and Catherine keener was very much underused and the main burden of acting was down to the three teenagers. The way the film plays it that of a teenage high school movie very similar to Harry potter but with a more starting grown up feel, because the First harry potter was for kids and the first Percy Jackson is for teenagers due to the amount of sexual references from a very funny from Grover character. So on personal note i am giving this thumbs up for trying to breathe live into a stagnant Greek mythology era, much like the western is trying to do with the remake of true grit and cowboys and aliens next year.","rating":7,"review_summary":"Percy Jackson ?

{"review_date":"29 October 2016","movie_id":"tt4263482","user_id":"ur4669024","is_spoiler":false,"review_text":"One of the most complex and haunting films to emerge within the past decade, writer\/director Robert Eggers' \"The Witch\" is a troubling fable of religion and fanaticism expertly combined with the trappings of a classic horror story of witchcraft and savagery. Though perhaps misrepresented by a marketing campaign billing it is a straight- forward creepshow for the masses, the truth is that this is a hard-hitting and expertly crafted art-film, and is a rewarding and startling experience that will leave the open minded breathless. It is without doubt not a film for everyone, and its appeal will be limited... but this cannot detract from the fact that it is a masterpiece from a brilliant new voice in film.New England. The 17th Century. A family is excommunicated from their Puritanical plantation home due to their extreme and fanatical religious views that conflict with the establishment of their peers. Father William (Ralph Ineson) helps his flock to build and craft a new home on the edge of a vast forest, where he hopes to create a new life for his family- wife Katherine (Kate Dickie), son Caleb (Harvey Scrimshaw), daughter Thomasin (Anya Taylor-Joy), twins Mercy and Jones (Ellie Grainger, Lucas Dawson) and infant son Samuel. However, not all is well. The disappearance of Samuel while playing with Thomasin causes an emotional rift within the family, tensions begin to run high due to the circumstances of their situation, mistrusts and deceits are slowly born and will push their limits of their devotion to one another and to god... and it soon becomes apparent that an otherworldly force may be at play... that a witch of the woods may be silently stalking the family.The film is Kubrickian in nature, relying on the slow and methodical establishment of character and atmosphere combined with complex metaphors and symbols to create a masterwork of terror and drama. It is a finely tuned experience, relying on the subtle and the suggestive as opposed to the overt and blatant. Rewarding the analytical and open among audiences, Eggers excels in his craft, building the narrative slowly and with great deliberation while constantly developing and evolving his characters. And while it may seem counter-intuitive, the film is oddly enough at its strongest not when delivering the plethora of chilling sequences and scares that are abundant. But rather, the film is at its strongest when it places its focus on the collapsing nature of the family unit, torn apart by their own doubt and devotion to their obsessive beliefs... even at the expense of logic, reason and safety. Though don't be fooled... this is still very much a frightening film, with many terrifying moments thanks to the disturbing portrayal of witchcraft and savagery. It just also happens to be a very thoughtful, contemplative and complicated film that does great work with its themes, and can be interpreted in a number of ways.The performances are just marvelous and are the other main contributing factor to the film's great success when combined with Eggers' masterful writing and direction. Anya Taylor-Joy stands tall in a breakout performance in the role of Thomasin, who becomes our main focus early on. Taylor-Joy is a revelation and despite her relatively young age, injects complexity, doubt and pathos into the role in a way that is beyond her years. Incredible work. Ralph Ineson is the other stand- out here, as the increasingly troubled William. Ineson plays the character as hopeful but increasingly haunted by his own faith, and it's a stirring and emotional performance. Dickie makes for another great character as Katherine, and she is the perfect compliment to Thomasin and William within the story. I also will give high markings to child-actor Harvey Scrimshaw as the young Caleb. Child actors are a tough sell much of the time, but Scrimshaw (similar to Taylor-Joy) seems to possess a talent that far exceeds expectation and does the role justice.To be honest, I cannot say a single thing to the detriment of the film. But I do feel the need to stress something I touched upon in the beginning. This is not a standard horror flick, and many have felt let-down and deceived by the admittedly poor marketing created for the film's release. The film was touted as \"scary\" and \"creepy\" and \"something we should not be seeing\" in a trailer filled with loud music stingers and many of the film's scares, suggesting a more straight-forward experience. This is not a horror film for the masses. This is not the sort-of movie a group of 17-year-olds will go to on a Friday night and feel fulfilled by. This is very much an art- picture. A movie that encourages thought and personal interpretation. And I think that far too many have dismissed it unfairly for failing to adhere to its poor marketing, as opposed to embracing it for what it actually is. To an extent, I understand feeling duped. And I'm not even a pretentious art-type. I love the \"Saw\" movies more than most. I get kicks out of brainless schlock like Stephen Sommers' \"Van Helsing\" and screwball comedies like \"Brain Donors.\" And I think \"The Adventures of Pluto Nash\" isn't nearly as bad as everyone makes it out to be. But you know what? I also appreciate true art. I adore it and embrace it and celebrate it. And \"The Witch\" is art at its purest. And I firmly believe it is unfair to condemn the film because the trailer wasn't the best representation of it.I give \"The Witch\" a perfect 10. It is not only amongst the best horror films of the decade. It is simply amongst the best films of the decade, regardless of genre.","rating":10,"review_summary":"\"The Witch\"-  A haunting and complex fable.","cleaned_review_text":"one complex haunt film emerg within past decad writerdirector robert egger witch troubl fabl religion fanatic expertli combin trap classic horror stori witchcraft savageri though perhap misrepres market campaign bill straight forward creepshow mass truth hardhit expertli craft artfilm reward startl experi leav open mind breathless without doubt film everyon appeal limit detract fact masterpiec brilliant new voic filmnew england th centuri famili excommun puritan plantat home due extrem fanat religi view conflict establish peer father william ralph ineson help flock build craft new home edg vast forest hope creat new life famili wife katherin kate dicki son caleb harvey scrimshaw daughter thomasin anya taylorjoy twin merci jone elli grainger luca dawson infant son samuel howev well disappear samuel play thomasin caus emot rift within famili tension begin run high due circumst situat mistrust deceit slowli born push limit devot one anoth god soon becom appar otherworldli forc may play witch wood may silent stalk familyth film kubrickian natur reli slow method establish charact atmospher combin complex metaphor symbol creat masterwork terror drama fine tune experi reli subtl suggest oppos overt blatant reward analyt open among audienc egger excel craft build narr slowli great deliber constantli develop evolv charact may seem counterintuit film oddli enough strongest deliv plethora chill sequenc scare abund rather film strongest place focu collaps natur famili unit torn apart doubt devot obsess belief even expens logic reason safeti though dont fool still much frighten film mani terrifi moment thank disturb portray witchcraft savageri also happen thought contempl complic film great work theme interpret number waysth perform marvel main contribut factor film great success combin egger master write direct anya taylorjoy stand tall breakout perform role thomasin becom main focu earli taylorjoy revel despit rel young age inject complex doubt patho role way beyond year incred work ralph ineson stand increasingli troubl william ineson play charact hope increasingli haunt faith stir emot perform dicki make anoth great charact katherin perfect compliment thomasin william within stori also give high mark childactor harvey scrimshaw young caleb child actor tough sell much time scrimshaw similar taylorjoy seem possess talent far exce expect role justiceto honest say singl thing detriment film feel need stress someth touch upon begin standard horror flick mani felt letdown deceiv admittedli poor market creat film releas film tout scari creepi someth see trailer fill loud music stinger mani film scare suggest straightforward experi horror film mass sortof movi group yearold go friday night feel fulfil much art pictur movi encourag thought person interpret think far mani dismiss unfairli fail adher poor market oppos embrac actual extent understand feel dupe im even pretenti arttyp love saw movi get kick brainless schlock like stephen sommer van hels screwbal comedi like brain donor think adventur pluto nash isnt nearli bad everyon make know also appreci true art ador embrac celebr witch art purest firmli believ unfair condemn film trailer wasnt best represent iti give witch perfect amongst best horror film decad simpli amongst best film decad regardless genr","label":0}

Forgetting Sarah Marshall is a very similar experience to watching a Bo Derek movie called \"10\" \u0096 it's a little risqu\u00e9 and rude; it's aimed squarely at a specific target audience; and it's not as funny as everyone involved would like you to think. Ten or fifteen years from now, I think this film will be largely forgotten.TV and movie score composer Peter Bretter (Jason Segal) is dumped by his hot girlfriend, TV actress Sarah Marshall (Kristen Bell). He attempts a few relationships with other girls, but each time is more disastrous than the last. Eventually Peter is persuaded by his brother to go on vacation. He chooses Hawaii as there is a resort there which Sarah often spoke highly of. Upon arrival, Peter is shocked to discover that Sarah is taking a vacation there too with her new flame, narcissistic rocker Aldous Snow (Russell Brand). The situation looks like it's going to get out of hand until Peter befriends a pretty hotel receptionist named Rachel (Mila Kunis). Gradually he begins to develop feelings for Rachel and realises that there CAN be happiness after Sarah. He even reveals to Rachel his long-secret plan of creating a musical show based on Dracula, performed by a cast of puppets. But the course of true love is never smooth, and Peter suffers various calamities and misadventures before his fate in love is finally decided\u0085 Perhaps the chief strength of Forgetting Sarah Marshall is that it is romantic comedy for guys AND girls. There is a certain raunchy, vulgar flavour to the proceedings which tries to tap in to the notion of a \"male sense of humour\". Anyone thinking they're about to watch a chick flick will quickly realise this is not so. The performances are broadly what you would expect \u0096 Segal is amusing, the girls are pretty but shallow, and Russell Brand basically plays himself. The Hawaiian locations provide a lush backdrop. There are flashes of male and female nudity, none of them particularly gratuitous but none of them all that necessary either. In the script department, the story proceeds in a fairly predictable manner, with clich\u00e9d characters and comic situations which could have been lifted from any TV sitcom. At 110 minutes (or 117 minutes if you're watching the extended version), the film is around ten or fifteen minutes longer than it ought to be, but it doesn't tax the patience to excessive levels. An easy, lazy watch overall\u0085 but not particularly worthy of the adulation that has been heaped upon it.","rating":5,"review_summary":"Very mildly amusing comedy, mainly vulgar and predictable.","cleaned_review_text":"felt like scroogelik miser watch forget sarah marshal around cinema peopl slap thigh roar laughter wipe tear mirth eye want join realli wasnt feel film amus occasion frequent didnt true laughoutloud moment could probabl count one hand forget sarah marshal similar experi watch bo derek movi call littl risqu rude aim squar specif target audienc funni everyon involv would like think ten fifteen year think film larg forgottentv movi score compos peter bretter jason segal dump hot girlfriend tv actress sarah marshal kristen bell attempt relationship girl time disastr last eventu peter persuad brother go vacat choos hawaii resort sarah often spoke highli upon arriv peter shock discov sarah take vacat new flame narcissist rocker aldou snow russel brand situat look like go get hand peter befriend pretti hotel receptionist name rachel mila kuni gradual begin develop feel rachel realis happi sarah even reveal rachel longsecret plan creat music show base dracula perform cast puppet cours true love never smooth peter suffer variou calam misadventur fate love final decid perhap chief strength forget sarah marshal romant comedi guy girl certain raunchi vulgar flavour proceed tri tap notion male sens humour anyon think theyr watch chick flick quickli realis perform broadli would expect segal amus girl pretti shallow russel brand basic play hawaiian locat provid lush backdrop flash male femal nuditi none particularli gratuit none necessari either script depart stori proce fairli predict manner clichd charact comic situat could lift tv sitcom minut minut your watch extend version film around ten fifteen minut longer ought doesnt tax patienc excess level easi lazi watch overal particularli worthi adul heap upon","label":1}

Have you ever seen a depressed person in your life? Have you ever been depressed yourself? I assume that you haven't because Kristen portrayed depression so well! So well that I was taken back to my depression and had a slight relapse and through that relapse I understood some things that I hadn't at that time of my life (and that is partly from seeing this movie) I have also seen so many people who have been depressed, and it was just like she showed! And the screaming in from her nightmares...so good! Edward did an excellent job as well! When he calls and finds out about the funeral, he just plays that so well and then when he goes to the Volturi....wow! Amazingly well done! And those people saying they have no chemistry...uh hello...there is total chemistry there. From the first moment that she sees Edward at the school lot, you can see the chemistry! Maybe you don't know what chemistry is....you probably need to find yourself a boy mate! I thought all the movie was well acted and well done! It followed the book well. Yeah it skipped some, but you can't get an entire book in a 2 hour movie -k- Get a clue people! The screenplay was excellent! You know, if you read the movie companion, Stephenie Meyer was involved in this entire movie!

Yes, the movie was sort of cute, but the heroine was way too sickly sweet in my opinion. Snow White had grace, beauty and kindness, but because of her complete lack of flaws she came across as boring. So I ended up rooting for the evil Queen instead.Universal Pictures' \"Snow White and the Huntsman\" was promoted as a movie where Snow White got to be independent, strong and brave. In the trailers you saw Snow White (Kristen Stewart) preparing an army for battle, fighting and yelling. They actually made it seem like they had made Snow White a two-dimensional character that was more than a pretty face. So why did I still end up rooting for the evil Queen?The main problem with the movie is the casting of Snow White. While they never implied that Snow White actually is fairer than the Queen (Charlize Theron) physically \u0096 they emphasized more on her inner beauty and kind spirit \u0096 they couldn't have meant to make Queen Ravenna more sympathetic too. Since Stewart is such a limited actress she has trouble making Snow White likable and relatable, mainly because of her mannerisms (eye-rolling, mouth-breathing, monotone voice). Theron however is a nuanced actress that conveys every single one of Ravenna's personality traits and feelings effortlessly. There have been criticisms of her over-acting, but I felt like the character was supposed to be dramatic and Theron's performance captured that perfectly. She makes Ravenna a tragic but heartbreaking portrait of a woman too obsessed with youth and beauty for her own good (there is a very sad back-story of how she came to be as obsessed with beauty as she is.)Story-wise the movie doesn't stray far from the classic fairytale. The story of how Snow White's mother dies and her father then remarries a beautiful but evil woman has remained intact. The part where the evil queen has a huntsman going after Snow White for her heart has been emphasized more with the huntsman (Chris Hemsworth) now becoming an ally\/love interest for Snow White. The poison apple, the dwarfs and the prince all make appearances too. But the ending is more of an actual battle (horses, swords et cetera) than in the classic fairytale, and it also needs to be said that the movie has an overall darker feel.Apart from Theron's performance, the movie's main strength lies in its visuals. The set decoration, locations and editing are all breathtaking \u0096 but Colleen Atwood's costumes are the main draw. Never in my life have I seen such detailed and beautiful gowns as those Ravenna wears. They add an air of luxury and indulgence to the movie and are a shoe-in for a \"Best Costume\"-nomination at next years' Oscars. The music score is fantastic too, and James Newton Howard proves just like he did in \"The Hunger Games\" what a great composer he is.Overall \"Snow White and the Huntsman\" could use a better lead actress and some cutting (the middle part of the movie feels dragged out) but remains an entertaining, adventurous film for fans of epic fantasy movies. And fans of Charlize Theron shouldn't miss it for the world \u0096 she proves that she is not only the fairest of them all but one of the best actresses in contemporary Hollywood.","rating":8,"review_summary":"A fairly original take on a traditional fairytale","cleaned_review_text":"grow rememb never quit like disney snow white ye movi sort cute heroin way sickli sweet opinion snow white grace beauti kind complet lack flaw came across bore end root evil queen insteadunivers pictur snow white huntsman promot movi snow white got independ strong brave trailer saw snow white kristen stewart prepar armi battl fight yell actual made seem like made snow white twodimension charact pretti face still end root evil queenth main problem movi cast snow white never impli snow white actual fairer queen charliz theron physic emphas inner beauti kind spirit couldnt meant make queen ravenna sympathet sinc stewart limit actress troubl make snow white likabl relat mainli manner eyerol mouthbreath monoton voic theron howev nuanc actress convey everi singl one ravenna person trait feel effortlessli critic overact felt like charact suppos dramat theron perform captur perfectli make ravenna tragic heartbreak portrait woman obsess youth beauti good sad backstori came obsess beauti isstorywis movi doesnt stray far classic fairytal stori snow white mother die father remarri beauti evil woman remain intact part evil queen huntsman go snow white heart emphas huntsman chri hemsworth becom allylov interest snow white poison appl dwarf princ make appear end actual battl hors sword et cetera classic fairytal also need said movi overal darker feelapart theron perform movi main strength lie visual set decor locat edit breathtak colleen atwood costum main draw never life seen detail beauti gown ravenna wear add air luxuri indulg movi shoein best costumenomin next year oscar music score fantast jame newton howard prove like hunger game great compos isoveral snow white huntsman could use better lead actress cut middl part movi feel drag remain entertain adventur film fan epic fantasi movi fan charliz theron shouldnt miss world prove fairest one best actress contemporari hollywood","label":0}

The CGI is great (to my standards). I don't understand why everyone is hating on it, it looks great to me. Although the action was mostly fast paced and kept you on your toes, there were quite a couple of plot holes, the plot was extremely clich\u00e9, and didn't even make sense. It was the whole \"shoot the mother down and the rest will freeze\" type thing, but 1. that only really works with robots, and 2. that idea is way too overused at this point anyway. If you are the type of person to go see a movie just for the good action, then this movie is for you. If you are a critic of movies and inspect every aspect of the movie, it may not be for you. But, to this 17 year old boy, it was pretty entertaining and I had a lot of fun watching it!

He asks if Django knows the Brittle Brothers and with the affirmative, he buys Django for him. Then Dr. Schultz tells that he is a bounty hunter chasing John, Ellis and Roger Brittle and proposes a deal to Django: if he helps him, he would give his freedom, a horse and US$ 75.00 for him. Django accepts the deal and Dr. Schultz trains him to be his deputy. They kill the brothers in Daughtray and Django tells that he would use the money to buy the freedom of his wife Broomhilda (Kerry Washington), who is a slave that speaks German. Dr. Schultz proposes another deal to Django: if he teams- up with him during the winter, he would give one-third of the rewards and help him to rescue Broomhilda. Django accepts his new deal and they become friends. After the winter, Dr. Schultz goes to Gatlinburgh and learns that Broomhilda was sold to the ruthless Calvin Candie von Shaft (Leonardo DiCaprio), who lives in the Candyland Farm, in Mississippi. Dr. Schultz plots a scheme with Django to lure Calvin and rescue Broomhilda from him. But his cruel minion Stephen (Samuel L. Jackson) is not easily fooled. \"Django Unchained\" is a highly entertaining and funny movie by Quentin Tarantino. The story is a parody of the Italian spaghetti genre and works very well since the story is good and the cast is outstanding. Christoph Waltz \"steals\" the movie and the joke with Franco Nero is unforgettable.

I think one character actually convinced me he was actually a teenager and that was Brendan's brainy sidekick who knew everything about everyone in school, maybe because he actually was. It seemed that everyone were a little too mature for the roles they were given, in regards to the pregnancy and supposedly underage thugs getting killed. The emotions were well played but had little effect. But none of these flaws affected the signature of the movie's well drawn suspense. The dialog was almost hard to follow but was very creative and witty and the characters were very detailed such as The Pin, Dode and the Tug. I just wanted to go into the movie and tell Brendan, Dode, and the Tug to get some fresh clean clothes.

{"review_date":"2 March 2017","movie_id":"tt0119217","user_id":"ur73216124","is_spoiler":true,"review_text":"As of recently, many films catered towards teenagers are centered around immature humor and high school stereotypes. Unfortunately, most of these movies fail to appear relate-able or funny, very much inside the spectrum of normal to mediocre. The film Good Will Hunting, however, is somehow a more genuine approach at a coming-of-age story, with amazing acting performances and well written scripts. The movie experience is a true joy, and portrays life and maturity in a manner that is touching and heartfelt. Being a mathematical genius, the main character Will Hunting is a disenchanted youth struggling with his identity and pressures of the environment around him. This being a typical movie plot line, it is both revolutionary and surprising in the tactful way it is handled. Although the film \"Good Will Hunting\" centers around an extraordinary genius, the themes of identity, emotional healing, and love successfully imparts a universal message to the quintessential viewer. One of the wonderful aspects of \"Good Will Hunting\" is the portrayal of identity and acceptance in the transition to adulthood. Though Will has an extraordinary capacity for knowledge, his angst and confident attitude only masks the true damage and doubt that lurks. Coping with outside pressures from his mentoring professor, Professor Lambeau, (who is intent on having him enter the modern world as a researcher), Will must search within himself and find out what he actually wants to do with his life. The professor believes that Will should use his intelligence to influence the world around him, but meanwhile, Will is uncertain in the future he would like to lead. A strong-willed, widowed therapist, named Dr. Sean Maguire, portrayed fantastically by the late Robin Williams, helps Will to delve into his own feelings while also becoming a mentor and friend. Through the emotionally trying sessions, Will realizes the true pain and brokenness within himself, and in much thought, decides to follow the girl he loves. Although themes of identity and adulthood may seem common and overdone, \"Good Will Hunting\" presents its case with its poised and genuine approach. The theme of emotional healing and vulnerability is present throughout the entire movie, and handles the topic both uniquely and succinctly. One of the most memorable lines of the movie is by the therapist, who says, \"It is not your fault.\" This idea of blame and almost self punishment does not only apply to Will Hunting, a formerly abused child, but also the average person in the world. Even though each situation is different, oftentimes when one is experiencing emotional turmoil, self confidence withers and vulnerability is shied away from. The seemingly impenetrable Will is reduced to tears with these simple words, the scene both shocking and touching. By making key choices in characterization and scripting, the film beautifully portrays barriers being broken down. The movie ultimately teaches that, eventually, hindrances must be faced, and though the situation may seem incredibly bleak, one is able to be good again. Lastly, of course with every coming-of-age film comes the idea of love, both in the platonic and romantic sense. Interestingly, the romance does not feel forced or clich\u00e9, and the emphasis seems to be more on brotherly relationships than Will's growing affection for Skyler, a university student. Despite being surrounded with a band of rambunctious and loyal friends, Will still has yet to trust and depend on someone emotionally. By being an accessible, coarse, and vulnerable human being, Dr. Sean Maguire is able to pierce through Will's thick facade, and allows Will to have a mentor to guide him in the world. The movie truly showcases that oftentimes the most important relationships that are made in life are produced out of vulnerability and dependence. \"Good Will Hunting\" depicts beautifully and realistically the extent of a human friendship, and how oftentimes the strange and unwelcome guests in one's life can change it for the better. The movie, \"Good Will Hunting,\" is definitely not a clich\u00e9, sappy, teenage film.

The only difference is that they get to write about the movie and are forced to see hundreds of movies whether they want to or not.Therefore, it is our belief that if you get your monies worth for two hours of enjoyment that is good enough for us!

{"review_date":"18 December 2011","movie_id":"tt1515091","user_id":"ur2115026","is_spoiler":true,"review_text":"Guy Ritchie has proved himself quite a stylish director. He has given us \"Rock'n'Rolla\" and the first of the Sherlock series before. Somehow, he has lost control of the material recently, and this is most obvious in the latest entry Holmes entry.The film is a visual stunner, easily with \"The Tree of Life\" and \"HP VII\/ Part II\", one of the best looking movies ever filmed. This film truly transports us back to the early days of the XX Century and makes us feel like we are really in the middle of the very polluted capitals of Europe, the exquisite photography immersing us in the world of shadows which was part of that society day and night. The film allows us to almost feel the torture of the upholstery, the lush velvet of the costumes, and the sumptuous decadence of the wealthy classes. Every aspect of the art direction should be recognized as the best of the best, and I wish the story would be allowed to reach those levels.Doyle's Holmes and Watson are truly two of the most intelligent and fascinating characters in literature; as a pair, they might have no match, and Moriarty is the perfect villain, but the way these films treat the development of the story and the characters themselves is a shame, for Ritchie prefers to have slow motion takes to show bullets or flash editing to detract from the impact of a good action scene. He does redeem himself twice in the scenes with Moriarty and Holmes, but that is what makes the whole two hours truly frustrating because one yearns for more of what could have made the films great, and we get a lot of beautiful shots of violence and mayhem, but little of what truly matters.This film takes us through the philosophical studies of what man's self destructive nature, and how evil geniuses profit from man's tragic disposition. As I mentioned before because of the film's truncated style, it is hard to truly appreciate the battle of the minds. It is a cat and mouse chase through some lovely scenery and it ends with the ultimate solution, the final solution, a chess move so diabolical, the audiences gasp, and in what could have an amazing cliffhanger, with a true open end, or not, depending on how carefully you have reviewed the clues along the way, Ritchie goes the easy away. Can we hear the audience papers results being read? Downey and Law do very well. Rapace is truly wasted, and it is hard to believe she gave the best performance of the year in 2010. In this film, we are in for easy laughs, little is explained as to why Holmes want to blend into the background or dress as a cheap slut. His mind is best asset but you couldn't tell from this film. You'll have a better time reading the short stories or checking out the old films.

After having written Misery into the ground for several years Paul decides it's time to retire Misery and kills off the beloved character in his latest book. Moving onto his new project he spends months hidden away in a hotel in the mountains of Colorado writing his new project. After completing his newest manuscript Paul checks out of his hotel and drives his old mustang back into town. However a severe snow storm makes driving an impossibility as Paul drives right off the hill. Paul awakens in the guest room of Annie Wilkes, played by Kathy Bates, a retired nurse living by her lonesome in a secluded cabin. Annie tells Paul that she's his biggest fan and she has read every single one of his Misery books. With the storm knocking out the phone lines and roads Annie tells Paul it's best he just sit tight for awhile while his body heals. Paul's legs are shattered and one of his shoulders has been dislocated. After a couple of days of being nursed back to health Paul is anxious to speak with his agent and daughter but when Annie reads Paul's latest Misery novel she explodes with outrage. She won't stand for her beloved Misery's death. Annie, showing her psychotic and violent tendencies forces Paul to burn his newest manuscript and holds Paul prisoner until he writes the revival of Misery. Locked in a room and presumed dead by the outside world, Paul only hope is the local sheriff, played by Richard Farnsworth who is slowly flowing bread crumbs of his disappearance. Misery is great screenplay with a solid accumulation of twists and turns. The shooting style is a little dated but the use of wide angle close ups does wonders for making Annie Wilkes the scariest nurse you've ever seen. Her bipolar performance is definitely worthy of the Oscar. James Caan is also terrific as the witty and clever writer. I mainly know him from his stereotypical bad-guy roles but he also plays a great sympathetic cripple. One thing that I have to note is the amazing job done on the make up. The swollen broken legs of Paul look absolutely disgusting. Misery is a great horror flick and Kathy Bates will probably go down as the most terrifying nurse in cinematic history. Who this film is not for: -Even though I'm not into the horror genre, I really enjoyed this film.

As such, the film sets a terrible scene through whose colouring we are to view the rather too idealistic 'law enforcement' intentions of the female FBI agent. It is this character, played admirably by Blunt, that is the weakest link. This character seems incapable of asking questions, of making intelligent assessments of what is going on around her and, at one point, is reliant on a much more junior operative to do what she should have done. We are then supposed to believe that this character knows no self-defence moves and nearly gets herself murdered. To cap it all, whilst refusing to 'sign' a false declaration on grounds of principle nearly does the most foul of deeds - shooting a man in the back. Ridiculous, and really takes the edge off what should have been a really hard hitting, realistic and thrilling drama. Benicio Del Toro pulls off the most impressive performance of all as Alejandro.

From the over-rated Carrie, to the under-rated Snake Eyes, the classic Untouchables and the downright hideous Mission to Mars and Scarface, he's been through just about everything. But Mission: Impossible was his first true mega-hit. Movies from TV shows are a dime a dozen these days and are rarely taken seriously, I mean look at trash like S.W.A.T. or Dukes of Hazard, but M:I is actually supposed to be a continuation of the show, rather than a spin-off.Tom Cruise is Ethan Hunt (no, not cockney rhyming slang) an IMF agent who's entire team is killed in a phony sting operation in Prague. Accused of being a traitor he legs it before they can nab him and assembles a team of rogue operatives to find out who the REAL traitor is. Many double-crosses and double-double crosses ensue.For those who cannot follow the plot there are some really good set-pieces with enough tension and excitement to carry the whole movie. You'll know by now the dangling scene in the top-secret room but the best scene in the movie is the high-speed train rocketing through the English countryside. While other directors might use this as a chance to show off, De Palma keeps it as realistic as possible which makes it infinitely more cooler.Parts of the movie may seem a bit dated now and it's weird seeing Tom Cruise look like a little boy even though he was already 33. He even sounds different. And what kind of supervillian uses floppy discs? They could have tried something a bit more high-tech there.The M:I franchise could be a heck a lot better, I suppose.

I should hate it for what it is because it's a thriller which just tries to look like a horror movie plus it stars David Arquette one of the most annoying actors in the business. But I still can't help myself from liking it.The plot is at sometimes rather smart. A killer is slaughtering people and terrorizing them by forcing them to answer questions about (in)famous horrormovies. Craven could and should have used this element more than he did since it's a pretty clever idea. Still he makes it work well.The movie has got some good actors in it: Neve Campbell, Courtney Cox, Skeet Ulrich, David Arquette is actually good as the nerdy cop here but I think that we should have had the rights to see more of Drew Barrymore. She's easily one of the best actresses in Scream.The movie has got some scenes packed full of suspense and tension. Sure some scenes may seem clich\u00e9d, but not so much that it doesn't work. And this is a movie about movies, so I guess that it wouldn't have that much of a point if it didn't seem clich\u00e9d at one point.The first time I saw this, I had a special kind of feeling in my stomach. I had a feeling that anything could happen. I don't think I've had that kind of feeling watching a movie ever since. It was my first contact with the horror world, even though this is more of a thriller than pure horror.The only downsides I can figure out was that the plot weakens at the end, and everyone tends to be look a bit too crazy to make it work as good as it should.So to spell it out: if you want to start to watch horror movies but you don't know where to begin than start here.

Like her TV show and standup, her riffs are transgressive bawdry. Her candour about cunnilingus, tampons and erections are tabu-turning cases in point.The three women of Snuff magazine establish the spectrum. Boss Dianna (Tilda Swinton) is the woman executive taught that success requires her to be like a man. Amy seems feminine in comparison, soft, recessive, but still stronger than Nikki, whose nerves \u0097 outside the women's toilet stalls \u0097 reduces her to a girlish titter. Nikki apologetically backs into the editorial promotion when Amy is fired for supposedly molesting an underage masochistic male intern. On this spectrum Amy struggles to find her integral balance of male and female. The two male writers reflect the same contrast between macho and effeminate. Naming a men's magazine Snuff clearly plays with the idea manliness kills. Hence Amy's line to the super endowed man: \"Have you ... before? Where is she buried?\" Amy is limited by her masculine traits. She was brainwashed by her father's conviction that \"Monogamy is unnatural.\" Where her sister outgrew that mantra to become a fulfilled wife and mother, Amy stuck at promiscuity and insecurity. She has the conventional male fear of commitment, urge to leave after sex, need to control the relationship. She reduces her men's sexuality to her immediate needs. The super-endowed pickup is thwarted when she falls asleep after her brisk orgasm. When her \"ice sculpture\" boyfriend gets into a quarrel at the cinema she feeds him lines that make him seem gay. Amy is saved from her insularity by her interview assignment with sports doctor Aaron (Bill Hader). He's idealized by his work for Doctors Without Borders and his fame as a major sports surgeon. Here the man plays the nurturing healer role, domesticating the uncontrolled sexuality of \u0097 completing the reversal \u0097 the woman. Hader's lunch scene with Lebron James is a male parody of he Women's Lunch, from their discussion of relationships and emotions to their careful parsing of the check. When Dr Aaron is served with an intervention he faces a range of sexual license. The soft, caring Lebron is joined by the very sensitive Matthew Broderick (married to the star of the seminal feminist Sex and the City), the lesbian Chris Evert and \u0097 to provide the play-by-play \u0097 by the erstwhile cross-dresser Marv Albert. Amy's intervention is an arranged scene with her step-nephew, who educes her affection for her lost Aaron. Amy wins Aaron back by performing a number with the Knicks' cheerleaders. She proves her new discipline and her desire to make their relationship work by performing the athletic ritual she initially disdained. She now accepts sports on Aaron's terms, as an agent of community. She also performs the persona of female sexuality, the antithesis to her Snuff work. The muscular hunk climaxed when he admitted that from behind she looked \"like a dude.\" That went with her male life-choice of promiscuity and flight from emotion. To recover her relationship with Aaron she embraces the female role as cheerleader and her new pool of emotions and commitment. Once an emotional trainwreck, she goes on track and pulls into a station.","rating":8,"review_summary":"Hardened girl learns to accept emotions and commitment","cleaned_review_text":"ami schumer trainwreck romant comedi stake new posit feminist rework american filmmost obvious schumer comedi candour profan tradit reserv men like tv show standup riff transgress bawdri candour cunnilingu tampon erect tabuturn case pointth three women snuff magazin establish spectrum boss dianna tilda swinton woman execut taught success requir like man ami seem feminin comparison soft recess still stronger nikki whose nerv outsid women toilet stall reduc girlish titter nikki apologet back editori promot ami fire supposedli molest underag masochist male intern spectrum ami struggl find integr balanc male femal two male writer reflect contrast macho effemin name men magazin snuff clearli play idea manli kill henc ami line super endow man buri ami limit masculin trait brainwash father convict monogami unnatur sister outgrew mantra becom fulfil wife mother ami stuck promiscu insecur convent male fear commit urg leav sex need control relationship reduc men sexual immedi need superendow pickup thwart fall asleep brisk orgasm ice sculptur boyfriend get quarrel cinema feed line make seem gay ami save insular interview assign sport doctor aaron bill hader he ideal work doctor without border fame major sport surgeon man play nurtur healer role domest uncontrol sexual complet revers woman hader lunch scene lebron jame male parodi women lunch discuss relationship emot care pars check dr aaron serv intervent face rang sexual licens soft care lebron join sensit matthew broderick marri star semin feminist sex citi lesbian chri evert provid playbyplay erstwhil crossdress marv albert ami intervent arrang scene stepnephew educ affect lost aaron ami win aaron back perform number knick cheerlead prove new disciplin desir make relationship work perform athlet ritual initi disdain accept sport aaron term agent commun also perform persona femal sexual antithesi snuff work muscular hunk climax admit behind look like dude went male lifechoic promiscu flight emot recov relationship aaron embrac femal role cheerlead new pool emot commit emot trainwreck goe track pull station","label":1}

Despite the phenomenal casting, this movie wasn't worth the trouble. The basic premise is that the a bunch of astronauts in the not-too-distant future are on a mission to the sun. If they'd left it at that, it wouldn't have been so bad, but I think most of our fourth graders know that when the sun burns out it's going to become a red giant, not a lazy lite-brite.If this movie had been just about the group dynamics, then it would have been fantastic. Something goes critically wrong; whose fault is it? The guy who made the mistake, the guy who made the decision or the guy who had the idea? They could've made this flick a gripping psychological drama easily.Any bomb meant to rejuvenate a sun would need to have more mass than Manhattan Island. It would probably need to have more mass than Jupiter, but while the movie makers may have skimped on the physics, they did their homework on the group dynamics. Any large-scale space mission in the 21st century would have contributors from China, Japan, France, Russia and the U.S. There would be one engineer assigned specifically to the complicated life support system. There would be one psychologist. Even so, tensions would run high for this small, claustrophobic group on a years-long mission.Unfortunately, the version of the movie shown to me at the advanced screening did not linger to explore the ticking human timebomb. It moved on to the standard Ghost Ship\/Monster on Board nonsense. Sure, the quasi-religious ravings were somewhat redeeming, but it was still a loss.The most interesting part is established right at the beginning, as Capa sends a message to his parents.

What fascinates me more, however, is to what extent Brandon Lee's premature death indirectly influenced the undeniable \"softening\" of the finished product? I'm familiar with the comic strips by James O'Barr and they're definitely bloodier and more violent than this film, which merely suggests a whole lot of bloody massacres but doesn't show much. Personally, I really wonder whether or not Lee's unfortunate passing away encouraged director Alex Proyas' and his producers to make their film slightly more sentimental. This is NOT a point of criticism, mind you, as I really think \"The Crow\" is near brilliant with an overwhelming Gothic atmosphere, wonderfully dark set pieces and a genuinely moving love story! Back in 1994, Alex Proyas' \"The Crow\" dethroned \"Batman\" as the best comic book adaptation thus far and it remained the best until Robert Rodriguez came along in 2005, with his excellent interpretation of the pitch-black comic strip \"Sin City\". The story is standard-horror material, with a restless soul rising from the grave to avenge the murder of his beloved girl as well as his own. But it's decorated more beautifully, with a mythical crow representing the life force of this \"angel\" and the ultra-grim reproduction of dangerous Detroit. It is here that rock star Eric Draven and his girlfriend Shelley were brutally murdered during \"Devil's Night\"; a disturbing celebration on the night before Halloween when criminal gangs set fire to random buildings. During his killing spree, Draven comes to the conclusion that the gang members that killed him are only pawns of a much larger crime syndicate. The flashbacks in which Eric relives his maudlin final moments with the love of his life are truly saddening whereas the hunt for his victims is very exciting. Apart from Brandon Lee, whose acting is really sublime, \"The Crow\" also features many other brilliant actors who're all scandalously underrated, such as Michael Wincott, Ernie Hudson, John Polito and even Tony \"Candyman\" Todd. The later sequels almost bring shame to this masterpiece, though, so avoid them at all costs!","rating":10,"review_summary":"Morbid, saddening, beautiful, haunting...","cleaned_review_text":"film thatll cours alway relat tragic death talent young actor verg cinemat breakthrough sadli enough also acknowledg probabl never would success case horribl accid wouldnt occur regardless well made crow fact fascin howev extent brandon lee prematur death indirectli influenc undeni soften finish product im familiar comic strip jame obarr theyr definit bloodier violent film mere suggest whole lot bloodi massacr doesnt show much person realli wonder whether lee unfortun pass away encourag director alex proya produc make film slightli sentiment point critic mind realli think crow near brilliant overwhelm gothic atmospher wonder dark set piec genuin move love stori back alex proya crow dethron batman best comic book adapt thu far remain best robert rodriguez came along excel interpret pitchblack comic strip sin citi stori standardhorror materi restless soul rise grave aveng murder belov girl well decor beauti mythic crow repres life forc angel ultragrim reproduct danger detroit rock star eric draven girlfriend shelley brutal murder devil night disturb celebr night halloween crimin gang set fire random build kill spree draven come conclus gang member kill pawn much larger crime syndic flashback eric reliv maudlin final moment love life truli sadden wherea hunt victim excit apart brandon lee whose act realli sublim crow also featur mani brilliant actor whore scandal underr michael wincott erni hudson john polito even toni candyman todd later sequel almost bring shame masterpiec though avoid cost","label":1}

The CGI and spaceship design gets high fives all around. Truly a remarkable achievement here. I was in awe of the visual presentation and the enormous amount of thought that must have gone into this work.Great acting. Both main characters deliver a performance with an emotional range that is very believable. How would you handle yourself all alone on a gigantic ship irreversibly hurling through space? You'll find the answers here for sure.Cons: Fishburne's character seems mildly odd and out of place in the story. I find it too remarkable a coincidence a high-ranking crew member would accidentally be woken up just in time to provide much needed help as far as gaining access to secured areas of the ship. This derailed the plot for me a great deal.Bad science. When you are a confirmed Sci-Fi fan, you have to get used to things like that. But there are some truly glaring anomalies here. The ship is supposed to be traveling at 93,000 miles a second, or half the speed of light. That's 335 MILLION miles an hour. You are not going to be able to view a passing star with such magnificent grandeur, but again the CGI is overwhelmingly good, so it's forgivable. Unsatisfying ending. Too quick and convenient. I would have loved to know far more about how the main characters lived out the rest of their lives rather than the little bit that was shown. It simply left too many questions unanswered.Overall, not a waste of money or time, but 'Passengers' falls far short of making true cinematic history and will not be considered a classic in the sci-fi genera.Oh, well.","rating":6,"review_summary":"Somewhat Disappointing","cleaned_review_text":"expect high otherwis terrif presentationpro visual stun cgi spaceship design get high five around truli remark achiev awe visual present enorm amount thought must gone workgreat act main charact deliv perform emot rang believ would handl alon gigant ship irrevers hurl space youll find answer surecon fishburn charact seem mildli odd place stori find remark coincid highrank crew member would accident woken time provid much need help far gain access secur area ship derail plot great dealbad scienc confirm scifi fan get use thing like truli glare anomali ship suppos travel mile second half speed light that million mile hour go abl view pass star magnific grandeur cgi overwhelmingli good forgiv unsatisfi end quick conveni would love know far main charact live rest live rather littl bit shown simpli left mani question unansweredoveral wast money time passeng fall far short make true cinemat histori consid classic scifi generaoh well","label":1}

The second act of \"Pearl Harbor\", in which the Japanese attack the Naval base, contains some of the most visually stunning and heart-breaking moments ever produced in a war film.There is nothing else good about this movie.  That's not to say it's all bad, although a lot of it is--some of it actually rises to mediocrity.  But as an American, indeed as a human, I can't stand to think that the suffering and bravery of those lost in one of the most cowardly acts of war ever committed has been reduced to filler in a COMPLETELY predictable, sub-soap-opera love story.From the opening moments of the film, we are introduced to the poor writing and bad acting that permeates the film as two young boys realize that violence strengthens friendship.  They grow up, join the military, fall in love with the same woman, fight each other, fight the Japanese, hate each other, and then move into a final third act that any ten-year-old could predict.Meanwhile, this cartoon actually seems to believe it's being patriotic, that it is somehow paying tribute to those whom it claims to be about.  But this movie is just too stupid.  Think of it as an after-school special about WWII.  It's cheesy, it's uninspired, and it's insulting.  To think that after such excellent fictional war movies as \"Platoon\" and \"Saving Private Ryan\" one of the most pivotal moments in American history ends up being made as a teen flick . . .Now there's a tragedy.","rating":3,"review_summary":"Every American Should Be Insulted","cleaned_review_text":"let get good stuff way first sinc take least amount time second act pearl harbor japanes attack naval base contain visual stun heartbreak moment ever produc war filmther noth els good movi that say bad although lot issom actual rise mediocr american inde human cant stand think suffer braveri lost one cowardli act war ever commit reduc filler complet predict subsoapopera love storyfrom open moment film introduc poor write bad act permeat film two young boy realiz violenc strengthen friendship grow join militari fall love woman fight fight japanes hate move final third act tenyearold could predictmeanwhil cartoon actual seem believ patriot somehow pay tribut claim movi stupid think afterschool special wwii cheesi uninspir insult think excel fiction war movi platoon save privat ryan one pivot moment american histori end made teen flick there tragedi","label":0}
{"review_date":"27 September 2006","movie_id":"tt0287978","user_id":"ur2862544","is_spoiler":false,"review_text":"While he may not enjoy the popularity of Spider-Man, Batman and Superman, to many of his loyal fans, Daredevil is \"The Man Without Fear.\" Over his forty plus-year existence, the likes of John Romita (1960), Stan Lee ('64-69), Gene Colan ('65-75 \/ '78-79), Frank Miller ('79-83 \/ '86 \/ '93-94), John Romita Jr ('88-90), Joe Quesada ('98-2001), Kevin Smith ('98-99 -2001), David Mack ('99-2001), and Brian Michael Bendis (2001-06) have either written or drawn the 'devil. In a nice tribute, many of the minor characters in the movie are named after the preceding men, and Lee and Smith make cameo appearances. Like most of Lee's creations, Daredevil\/Matt Murdock came into being through a cataclysmic, if highly improbable, accident. As a young boy, Murdock was a gifted student, encouraged by his father, pugilist Jack \"The Devil\" Murdock, to make the most of his gifts. When a collision with a truck carrying barrels of toxic waste sent him blind, Matt's other four senses were heightened to superhuman levels. He could hear the most minute sound, and discovered a \"radar-sense\", created through vibration, which enabled him to be aware of his surroundings. When his father was murdered for refusing to throw a fight, Matt vowed to bring justice to those who couldn't afford it. By day, he would fight injustice in the courtroom (partnered by best friend Franklin \"Foggy\" Nelson); by night, he would become the vigilante Daredevil, defending the crime-ridden Hell's Kitchen.The original theatrical release of 'Daredevil' in 2004, starring DD aficionado Ben Affleck as The Man Without Fear, was, even for the most ardent fan, a flawed film. Its lean running time (99 minutes) and plot holes gave the impression it was just another comic-book action film, and didn't do Daredevil's legacy justice. The DVD release of the director's cut, however, has rectified those errors. Extended by half-an-hour, the addition of a subplot involving Murdock and Nelson defending Duante Jackson (Coolio), who was accused of killing a prostitute, helps tie the story together, with a twist that leads straight to The Kingpin (an imposing Michael Clarke Duncan), who runs Hell's Kitchen. The extra footage also gives 'Daredevil' a much darker edge. There's more violence and a bit more coarse language. The film is not without its lighter moments. The interplay between Affleck and Favreau is almost worth the price of the DVD alone. They even manage to squeeze in references to \"The Gong Show\" and \"Fight Club.\" The villains of the piece include Elektra (Jennifer Garner), Bullseye (Colin Farrell) and Kingpin\/Wilson Fisk (Michael Clarke Duncan). Elektra, a trained assassin, falls for Matt, but vows revenge on Daredevil, after mistakenly believing he killed her father during a street battle with Bullseye, a deadly, charismatic murderer who can turn any object into a weapon. The Kingpin runs crime in Hell's Kitchen, intent on eliminating \"The Man Without Fear\" and is shown to be a lot more brutal in the Director's Cut. While there are a few changes from the comic (which seems to be the norm with most comic-to-movie conversions), the fight between Elektra and Bullseye is all but ripped from the pages of Frank Miller's \"The Elektra Saga\".One of the most interesting aspects of the movie is the use of Daredevil's radar sense. Originally shown as a young Matt begins to harness his abilities, it comes to the fore in the bar fight with Jose Quesada, the movie's first real action piece. Daredevil's world is inhabited in blue, with shadows, amplified sounds and aromas, and shows, in some small respect, what it's like to be Daredevil.'Daredevil: Director's Cut' is a vast improvement on the original theatrical release, and may hopefully convince Daredevil's detractors of The Man Without Fear's worth. It's also worth checking out the fifteen minute documentary attached to the DVD release, called \"Giving the Devil his Due\", where director Mark Steven Johnson explains the creation of the new version, and explains why it was necessary in the first place.","rating":9,"review_summary":"Director's Cut does the Devil justice.","cleaned_review_text":"may enjoy popular spiderman batman superman mani loyal fan daredevil man without fear forti plusyear exist like john romita stan lee gene colan frank miller john romita jr joe quesada kevin smith david mack brian michael bendi either written drawn devil nice tribut mani minor charact movi name preced men lee smith make cameo appear like lee creation daredevilmatt murdock came cataclysm highli improb accid young boy murdock gift student encourag father pugilist jack devil murdock make gift collis truck carri barrel toxic wast sent blind matt four sens heighten superhuman level could hear minut sound discov radarsens creat vibrat enabl awar surround father murder refus throw fight matt vow bring justic couldnt afford day would fight injustic courtroom partner best friend franklin foggi nelson night would becom vigilant daredevil defend crimeridden hell kitchenth origin theatric releas daredevil star dd aficionado ben affleck man without fear even ardent fan flaw film lean run time minut plot hole gave impress anoth comicbook action film didnt daredevil legaci justic dvd releas director cut howev rectifi error extend halfanhour addit subplot involv murdock nelson defend duant jackson coolio accus kill prostitut help tie stori togeth twist lead straight kingpin impos michael clark duncan run hell kitchen extra footag also give daredevil much darker edg there violenc bit coars languag film without lighter moment interplay affleck favreau almost worth price dvd alon even manag squeez refer gong show fight club villain piec includ elektra jennif garner bullsey colin farrel kingpinwilson fisk michael clark duncan elektra train assassin fall matt vow reveng daredevil mistakenli believ kill father street battl bullsey deadli charismat murder turn object weapon kingpin run crime hell kitchen intent elimin man without fear shown lot brutal director cut chang comic seem norm comictomovi convers fight elektra bullsey rip page frank miller elektra sagaon interest aspect movi use daredevil radar sens origin shown young matt begin har abil come fore bar fight jose quesada movi first real action piec daredevil world inhabit blue shadow amplifi sound aroma show small respect like daredevildaredevil director cut vast improv origin theatric releas may hope convinc daredevil detractor man without fear worth also worth check fifteen minut documentari attach dvd releas call give devil due director mark steven johnson explain creation new version explain necessari first place","label":0}

Peter Jackson did an absolutely superb job bringing LOTR to the screen, due in large part to sticking very closely to Tolkien's work. (Okay, Arwen got inserted to provide a love interest, but she replaced Glorfindel in part.) And while LOTR may be both my favorite novel and film, I wouldn't say I'm a Jackson\/Tolkien fanboy as many here appear to be with their 10 of 10 scores.Given the success of LOTR by sticking to the story, I was nervous when I heard The Hobbit would also be a trilogy. Show me the money! The Hobbit is shorter than any of the 3 LOTR volumes. More importantly, it's told in an entirely different way. The Hobbit is a fairy tale, told breezily with large sections of narration. Its dwarfs are largely comical. LOTR though is an epic, deep in setting, detail, and dialogue. Still, because of the breeziness (e.g. important events are covered in a few pages, the narrator intentionally skipping forward intentionally in some places) I had hopes that Jackson's understanding of Tolkien would compensate.Did he? I must say, a mixed bag there. Certainly borrowing the settings, cinematography, tone, music, etc. from LOTR helped. Freeman's Bilbo matches Tolkien's pretty well, a simple fellow thrown into an adventure. The initial scene with the history of Smaug was a good way to give context to what follows. Whenever Jackson is sticking with Tolkien, things are great such as Gollum's scene.When Jackson is on his own though, the film drags. Jackson had to mine every reference and back story for additional screen time. It's safe to say than when a character not in the book is on screen, something ain't right. Radagast, Galadriel, Saruman, and CGI Azog add little. Moreover, the battle scenes are excessive in the extreme. In the book, there as no fight with the trolls nor with orcs approaching Rivendell. The \"main\" fight with the Great Goblin was over pretty quickly, with the dwarfs needing to flee rather than fight. That all 14 continuously and miraculously escape unharmed from multiple situations drains all the drama. (Just the fall into Goblintown should have killed them all.) But Jackson has to have his CGI\/video game fun, even though this too is filler.All in all, The Hobbit is not a bad film. Go see it. But it would have been better had Jackson told the tale it in just two films, sticking to Tolkien and thus the success formula for LOTR.","rating":7,"review_summary":"An Unrequired Epic","cleaned_review_text":"longtim tolkien fan like read work poster born peter jackson absolut superb job bring lotr screen due larg part stick close tolkien work okay arwen got insert provid love interest replac glorfindel part lotr may favorit novel film wouldnt say im jacksontolkien fanboy mani appear scoresgiven success lotr stick stori nervou heard hobbit would also trilog show money hobbit shorter lotr volum importantli told entir differ way hobbit fairi tale told breezili larg section narrat dwarf larg comic lotr though epic deep set detail dialogu still breezi eg import event cover page narrat intent skip forward intent place hope jackson understand tolkien would compensatedid must say mix bag certainli borrow set cinematographi tone music etc lotr help freeman bilbo match tolkien pretti well simpl fellow thrown adventur initi scene histori smaug good way give context follow whenev jackson stick tolkien thing great gollum scenewhen jackson though film drag jackson mine everi refer back stori addit screen time safe say charact book screen someth aint right radagast galadriel saruman cgi azog add littl moreov battl scene excess extrem book fight troll orc approach rivendel main fight great goblin pretti quickli dwarf need flee rather fight continu miracul escap unharm multipl situat drain drama fall goblintown kill jackson cgivideo game fun even though filleral hobbit bad film go see would better jackson told tale two film stick tolkien thu success formula lotr","label":0}

Batman.There's a 'tradition' in Hollywood whereby a writer, called in to 'fix' some out-of-control picture, decides to bail out, and, assuming he\/she has the Agent, the cash, and the 'pull', can actually have their names withdrawn from the so-called credits. It's not nearly as simple as all that for an actor wishing to slip out the back door, of course, given that their faces and voices are recognizable...and with that I offer my heartfelt condolences to Kevin Spacey and Frank Langella. With \"Superman Returns\" in his filmography, Mr. Spacey has probably single-handedly prevented any fisticuffs in arty film classes over arguments regarding his worst film ever. Thank you, Mr. Spacey.As for the fellow in the title role; anyone who thinks this guy is an actor, in the technical sense, must also be eagerly awaiting the handing of the Academy Award to one of those gay jocks in the Gillette razor commercials. It could happen, sure...The dialogue is a fine piece of work, and was obviously out-sourced to George Lucas, a fellow who has proved he knows nothing about the human species, nor its attempts to communicate.

Having Bond face his near equal is a terrific plot, and I thoroughly enjoy it every time I watch it.  Many people say that this was a disappointing movie, and the only disappointing aspect I find is the score by Eric Serra.  He massacred the sanctity of our beloved Bond Theme.  I prefer David Arnold's score from Tomorrow Never Dies 10 times more than Goldeneye.  I think that is the only major flaw in Goldeneye.  The stunts are terrifically thought out and performed, though many call the plane stunt in the pre-credits sequence unreal or impossible, yet they forget this is James Bond.  James Bond is a fantasy, and not all of the things are real.  James Bond movies take the world we live in and twist it a bit to make a great movie.  Take for instance Moonraker.  In Moonraker, they take advantage of the new space shuttles in the movie.  There are factual inconsistencies such as the fact that NASA could not launch a space shuttle just like that.  It takes major preparation to launch just one space shuttle, which includes combing the road where the space shuttle is taken down to the launching pad, test firings and numerous hours of training.  Even with this, they require a launch window, which I doubt would just happen to be there.  My point is, many things in Bond flicks are not total reality, but based on it, and that is why we love the films.

I thought the first \"Die Hard\" film was an enjoyable and energetic thrill ride. So with such a success, isn't it time for a sequel. Yes, \"Die Hard 2\" was born, released mere years after the original. This action sequel reunites Bruce Willis with his role, John McLane, from the first film. I think that \"Die Hard 2\", subtitled \"die harder\", is among the films I'd classify as the \"Great Action Movies\", a group of well-made action films that, to me, acts like a roller-coaster ride, making you wish that the theater would apply a seat belt buckle on your seat. Definitely it's on the par with other action films like the \"Indy Jones\" series, \"Lethal Weapon\" films, and the first \"Die Hard\". Actually, I think this is more enjoyable than the first film, but still shares the non-stop thrills and wall-to-wall action of its predecessor. It's a non-stop seat gripper that won't quit until it has ignited enough spark for two action films.As said, Willis returns as hero McLane, on a Washington airport, waiting for his wife's plane to depart. The plane that his wife (Bonnie Bedelia) is on board, is on of the planes that are circling around the airport, desperately delayed from their landing time. But things are about to get stickier when terrorists, led by Col. Stuart (William Sadler), a former government agent turned double-crosser, seize control of the airport's tower, and threaten to crash the beleaguered planes circling above. While already faced with a few problems, including a stubborn airport security (Dennis Franz), a hard-headed government specialist (John Amos), and his wife's plane desperately running out of fuel, McLane starts another all-out war against the mercenaries, and what follows is a thrill-packed adrenaline rush, that wouldn't have been possible, if not gifted with talented direction and superb action sequences.But the film isn't just good for that, \"Die Hard2\" is one of those very few sequels to great films that actually live up. or maybe better than their predecessor. This one did, and I more than appreciate it for that and so much more. Willis is always a charm as a strong, action hero that can make a charm to his role more than once. Director Renny Harlin keeps the film in a roaring pace that keeps on going and going until the credits roll. It's not at all easy to put up a sequel to a blockbuster film, and it's more of a challenge if your objective is to top the predecessor. But, well, they did. And, boy, did they do it right!

Within 24 hours, September 5\/6, 1972, during a tense and nail-biting stand-off all eleven Israeli captives and their eight Palestinian captors are killed in a shootout and grenade assault between the German police and Black September terrorists.Back in Israel Prime Minister Golda Meir,Lynn Cohen, gets the heads of the Mossad and IDF, Israeli Defense Forces,to plan what to do in the aftermath of the murdered 11 Israeli athletes. Even more important Premier Meir wants to show that actions like that in Munich will not go unavenged and unpunished. Trying to distance herself and her government Premier Meir has a secret group of Israelis assassins lead by her former bodyguard Avner, Eric Bana, get all the money and assistance that they need in finding the Munich 11, the Black September members who planned the Munich attack, and bring them to justice; instant justice with Avner and his men being judge jury & executioner.The movie \"Munich\" has Avner and his fellow covert Israeli Government assassins track down most of the Black September killers terminating seven of them including scores of accomplices by the time Avner's group was finally disbanded by Prime Minister Meir in June 1973. Still the Israeli hit team was unable to find and terminate the Big Salami and leader of the bunch who's name ironically is Ali Hassan Salameh, Mehdi Nebbon; were told at the end of he movie \"Munich\" that Ali Hassan Salameh was indeed killed by the Israeli Mossad in 1979.Penetrating and thought provoking real life thriller that shows the fine line between the Israeli hunters and Palestinian hunted. We also see how they suddenly switch later in the movie when the Black September terrorists start to turn the tables on the Israelis by tricking and trapping three of their agents, with the help of a beautiful but deadly Dutch femme fatal Jeanette(Marie Josee-Croze),leading to their deaths.Avner who was so eager and determined to do his job later started to get sick of killing and even felt a bit of sympathy for the hated Palestinians seeing that they, like himself an Israeli Jew, have a right to live in a land of their own. There's a very emotional exchange between Avner and Black September member Ali, Omar Metwally, who didn't know that he, Avnar, was Jewish and a Israeli covert agent out to kill him, which he did. This talk with Ali seemed to open Avnar up to seeing things beyond what he'd been exposed to as an Israeli, or native born Sabra, all his life. The movie ends with Avner together with his wife Daphna, Ayelet Zorner,and new born daughter living in Brooklyn New York unable or not wanting to return back to his native Israel and having nightmares over what he did and went through as a Israeli assassin. Avner now feels that he may well be terminated himself by the very people, the Israeli Mossad who he so secretly and effectively worked for. The reason Avner felt that way may have been because he couldn't keep what he did locked up within the four corners of his troubled mind.","rating":8,"review_summary":"I don't exist and you don't know me!","cleaned_review_text":"spoiler plan put israelipalestinian disput front page world major newspap shadowi black septemb group storm isra dorm olymp villag olymp athlet hous munich germani within hour septemb tens nailbit standoff eleven isra captiv eight palestinian captor kill shootout grenad assault german polic black septemb terroristsback israel prime minist golda meirlynn cohen get head mossad idf isra defens forcesto plan aftermath murder isra athlet even import premier meir want show action like munich go unaveng unpunish tri distanc govern premier meir secret group isra assassin lead former bodyguard avner eric bana get money assist need find munich black septemb member plan munich attack bring justic instant justic avner men judg juri executionerth movi munich avner fellow covert isra govern assassin track black septemb killer termin seven includ score accomplic time avner group final disband prime minist meir june still isra hit team unabl find termin big salami leader bunch who name iron ali hassan salameh mehdi nebbon told end movi munich ali hassan salameh inde kill isra mossad penetr thought provok real life thriller show fine line isra hunter palestinian hunt also see suddenli switch later movi black septemb terrorist start turn tabl isra trick trap three agent help beauti deadli dutch femm fatal jeanettemari joseecrozelead deathsavn eager determin job later start get sick kill even felt bit sympathi hate palestinian see like isra jew right live land there emot exchang avner black septemb member ali omar metwal didnt know avnar jewish isra covert agent kill talk ali seem open avnar see thing beyond hed expos isra nativ born sabra life movi end avner togeth wife daphna ayelet zornerand new born daughter live brooklyn new york unabl want return back nativ israel nightmar went isra assassin avner feel may well termin peopl isra mossad secretli effect work reason avner felt way may couldnt keep lock within four corner troubl mind","label":0}

I have seen so many disappointing war movies I have lost count. Lone Survivor though, was a truly great war film that is probably the best war movie of the past ten years. Now, I have no clue if these kind of films are realistic or not since I have never been in any situation remotely like the ones in this movie, but people I know who have been say that this movie is one of the only realistic war movies they have ever seen. That itself is something very rare. For those of you that do not know the plot to the movie, Lone Survivor tells the story of four NAVY SEALS who are tasked to go a mission to neutralize a high-level Taliban operative and are forced to fight for their lives when the mission goes wrong. It starts out with footage of NAVY SEALS training and it is amazing to believe all of the stuff they have to do to become biggest badasses in the world. I could not imagine how mentally and physically tough a person could be to go through all of that and all of these actors in Lone Survivor were able to portray these roles very well. Mark Wahlberg, who plays Marcus Luttrell, gave his usual amazing tough guy performance and gives this movie exactly the right character portrayal that it needs. Taylor Kitsch, who plays the leader of the mission Mike Murphy, gave probably the best performance of his career and I am very glad that he is finally is in a successful film. Emile Hirsch, who plays Danny Dietz, gives a good enough performance to make his character memorable enough. Without a doubt, the best performance of the movie was surprisingly by Ben Foster, who play Matt Axelson. He gave his character more life than any of the others. The acting though is not the thing that the audience remembers when they leave the theater.The action scenes are amazingly crafted and are the best I have ever seen. It just seems impossible how well the director was able to make it look like the NAVY SEALS got shot or fell through the forest like rag dolls. I do know who was the head of that department, but that guy deserves an Oscar. One thing that I also like about this movie is it doesn't just show the Middle Eastern people as the bad guys, Lone Survivor shows how a lot of the people are and how they feel about the Taliban. It really showed me a new light about the Gulf War and how it happened. What I personally loved about this movie, is the message that it leaves you with. It inspires you to go farther than you can possibly imagine and to never give up. It plants the idea in the audiences minds that if these NAVY SEALS can go through all of this stuff and not complain, I have a pretty good life and have very little to complain about. This movie could be a little too much for some people as it is pretty gory in some scenes, but for those who can handle it, you will love this movie and feel incredibly inspired as you walk out.

Fast with some sparkling set pieces and adrenaline soaked action the Last Crusade is one of the finest instalments to the series which has seen its ups and downs.The second part Temple of Doom received criticism for its overly played portrayal of an evil religion juxtaposed with the concept of human survival. This was somewhat far-fetched but nevertheless entertaining and so as part of a deal between director Spielberg and producer George Lucas, this third part was made and if anything was going to numb the critiques of the previous release, then this 1989 adventure sure did.Harrison Ford reprises the role of the most famous on screen archaeologist to wondrous applause with his usual cocky and knowledgeable portrayal of Jones. But what gives him the bit extra sophistication in this part is the encoded symbol of his father Henry Jones senior, played with knowledge and experience by Sean Connery. The pairing works wonders, creating plenty of humour and enough drama to grasp the emotional bond between the pair which brings together a story of survival and belief.Perhaps the most controversial of the entire series, part 3 takes a look at the legend of the Holy Grail, the symbol of everlasting life from biblical times. The journey towards its resting place is undoubtedly entertaining but what is interesting is that it is almost educational as facts are dropped about the legend. Having used the Ark of the Covenant in Raiders of the Lost Ark is followed by an equally in-depth look at God's powers.Last Crusade brings all the usual elements that are now expectant of the series. Fights, chases and dangerous animals. After seeing the great but horribly uncomfortable inclusion of the snake in Raiders it was almost equally spine tingling to view Indiana in the tunnel of rats, a squirming sequence that is rattled with action and suspense. As for chases the tank scenes stand out and although lasting a small time the boat sequence in Venice is memorable for some death defying thrills.Far more than an action adventure the inclusion of a mythical legend adds to the dazzle of the film's appeal and if you have seen the previous two then this is an essential watch The release of Kingdom of the Crystal Skull almost downgrading the reputation this could have been the finest swan song. This should be the moment when the tale of the archaeologist truly climaxed.","rating":9,"review_summary":"Sharp depiction the Grail and great action make second best part","cleaned_review_text":"father disappear archaeologist indiana jone ford set find find get lure quest find holi grailth third instal quadrilog defin term adventur fast sparkl set piec adrenalin soak action last crusad one finest instal seri seen up downsth second part templ doom receiv critic overli play portray evil religion juxtapos concept human surviv somewhat farfetch nevertheless entertain part deal director spielberg produc georg luca third part made anyth go numb critiqu previou releas adventur sure didharrison ford repris role famou screen archaeologist wondrou applaus usual cocki knowledg portray jone give bit extra sophist part encod symbol father henri jone senior play knowledg experi sean conneri pair work wonder creat plenti humour enough drama grasp emot bond pair bring togeth stori surviv beliefperhap controversi entir seri part take look legend holi grail symbol everlast life biblic time journey toward rest place undoubtedli entertain interest almost educ fact drop legend use ark coven raider lost ark follow equal indepth look god powerslast crusad bring usual element expect seri fight chase danger anim see great horribl uncomfort inclus snake raider almost equal spine tingl view indiana tunnel rat squirm sequenc rattl action suspens chase tank scene stand although last small time boat sequenc venic memor death defi thrillsfar action adventur inclus mythic legend add dazzl film appeal seen previou two essenti watch releas kingdom crystal skull almost downgrad reput could finest swan song moment tale archaeologist truli climax","label":0}

It is 15 minutes of pure nautical adrenaline, with a cool end taking place on top of still being built Millennium Dome.  Of course, none of that could EVER happen, but again, this is 007. This time around, James Bond must feel lucky having DR. Christmas Jones (Denise Richards of Starship Troopers fame) and Elektra King (Sophie Marceau from Braveheart) surrounding him. As awesome as the action is in this Bond film, the storyline is unmatched by any other Bond film. Although I rated this movie a 10, and it is my favorite 007 flick, I was a little upset at whomever made the choice to cast the young, beautiful, obviously not even close, Denise Richards as a nuclear scientist.

I mean, what were they thinking? \"Hmmm, the idea of a plumber running around, breaking bricks, killing enemies, and rescuing the princess is a boring idea, instead, let's just make up an entirely different plot.\" So after having pulled this totally unrelated and awful plot out of their rectum, they decided to go ahead and make the movie. Making video games out of movies is one thing, but making movies out of video games is a completely different story. You can make an excellent game out of a movie, but it is very hard to make an excellent movie out of a game.

Despite that she's admitted into a top-notch fashion magazine with a demonic female boss(which is somewhat dramatic of course),her dilemma about choosing between career and friends\/love is yet another thing that most of us will have something to say. As I see,it is the key of this film's appeal.Indeed,I shouldn't forget about the power of the cast.Attractive Anne Hathaway and great Meryl Streep.Lacking some handsome guys isn't the point,it's a film mainly about women: to be a career-obsessed woman or to be an ordinary women enjoying life is the question.And hell yeah,it's never solved.But this film,in the end,points out a direction for the women -well,perhaps implicitly -that smarter choice is to know your place and not to be so ambitious.As the cost you pay,seen in Miranda and Emily,is the absence of normal family and love relationship, is'the whole life that goes up in smoke'.Therefore,it can be argued that this film is ideologically conservative in nature.Average audiences won't care much about this,all we need is a good story and I think we have it in this film.Although there're some clich\u00e9s(such as the affair between Andy and Thompson),I have to say Streep plays quite well,also the actor starring Nigel.Hathaway could improve a bit but she's not too bad nonetheless.","rating":6,"review_summary":"Sincere,although a bit clich\u00e9d","cleaned_review_text":"therer lot film deal stori protagonist fight hisher way tough busi final either succeed quit know hisher placeson strength film ittoo pick sort storylinebut stori told sincer believ way instead hyperbol pretentiousnessalthough assum audienc go glamor part filmieth fanci shoesdress etcworn pretti hathawayon thing need note stori far access big brandsa newli graduat girl tri get job pay rent also open door load opportunitiesthi believ someth mani us identifi real life despit she admit topnotch fashion magazin demon femal bosswhich somewhat dramat courseh dilemma choos career friendslov yet anoth thing us someth say seeit key film appealindeedi shouldnt forget power castattract ann hathaway great meryl streeplack handsom guy isnt pointit film mainli women careerobsess woman ordinari women enjoy life questionand hell yeahit never solvedbut filmin endpoint direct women wellperhap implicitli smarter choic know place ambitiousa cost payseen miranda emilyi absenc normal famili love relationship isth whole life goe smokethereforeit argu film ideolog conserv natureaverag audienc wont care much thisal need good stori think filmalthough therer clichssuch affair andi thompsoni say streep play quit wellalso actor star nigelhathaway could improv bit she bad nonetheless","label":0}

I rarely find them as good as the billing. I think for some reason foreign films tend to be overindulged by reviewers. My pet theory is that English-speaking reviewers see a foreign film and are so happy to be able to follow it, the reviews suddenly are out of sight.With that comment setting the stage, I believe Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon was beautifully filmed, and had a plot that mostly made sense. Still, I have to say that the \"flying ninja\" scenes were silly, and there must have been some concepts that didn't translate in my Western mind because I didn't understand the ending at all (even if I speculate, it seems like such a waste).Now, now. I know the flying ninjas were graceful. And the fight in the treetops was daring. But I can only suspend reality so much. OK, fine, so this was a fantasy film, I guess. But even as a fantasy it looked silly. Why did they keep churning their legs as they flew? Wouldn't it make more sense to simply leap with straight or flexed legs and keep the air drag down? Why not windmill their arms and wear capes while they are at it? Where do you stop?The fight scenes were terrific overall, and not too repetitive. I've never liked martial arts movies because I could make no sense of a fight when five blows seem to have no effect, but 15 seconds later one blow of the same type knocks out an opponent. In CTHD, the fights take place in different settings and for different reasons, and don't feature wave after wave of faceless opponents who go down after taking 25-30 blows each. That was a nice surprise. The plot felt like an epic, moving back and forth in time to fill in back stories on characters. And it had one of the best plot devices of all, revenge and retribution.Still, the ending, while dramatic, seemed senseless. If a person grows through sadness and mistakes, in the Western world they become a better person (though the hard way). If they do what Jen finally did in CTHD, that is considered a coward's way out. But I suppose in the East, that takes courage. I dunno.Anyway, I gave CTHD an 8, because of the settings, for its epic story and because of a truly hilarious line about one man's home being a \"warehouse.\"","rating":8,"review_summary":"Um, uh, well, it was good, but ...","cleaned_review_text":"enjoy occasion foreign film foreign realiti either american english tend suspici arriv tremend high prais rare find good bill think reason foreign film tend overindulg review pet theori englishspeak review see foreign film happi abl follow review suddenli sightwith comment set stage believ crouch tiger hidden dragon beauti film plot mostli made sens still say fli ninja scene silli must concept didnt translat western mind didnt understand end even specul seem like wastenow know fli ninja grace fight treetop dare suspend realiti much ok fine fantasi film guess even fantasi look silli keep churn leg flew wouldnt make sens simpli leap straight flex leg keep air drag windmil arm wear cape stopth fight scene terrif overal repetit ive never like martial art movi could make sens fight five blow seem effect second later one blow type knock oppon cthd fight take place differ set differ reason dont featur wave wave faceless oppon go take blow nice surpris plot felt like epic move back forth time fill back stori charact one best plot devic reveng retributionstil end dramat seem senseless person grow sad mistak western world becom better person though hard way jen final cthd consid coward way suppos east take courag dunnoanyway gave cthd set epic stori truli hilari line one man home warehous","label":0}

Or a sports drama with romantic undertones? Or is it a fascinating character study introspecting the professional and private life of a sports pro manager, and the way these two poles of his personality influence and affect each other? I like the third option, especially since the title says it all; it's a film about a man named Jerry Maguire.So, who's Jerry Maguire? At first, he strikes as the kind of character tailor-made for Tom Cruise; Maguire is the guy who's successful both in business and privacy. In fact, the two worlds interact so intensively that you can't quite differentiate between his friends, his colleagues and his clients, even his fianc\u00e9, Avery (Kelly Preston) is an ex-athlete. Tom Cruise is the ultimate yuppie and he plays the part perfectly with this extraordinary capability to make himself unlikable enough so you can better perceive his redemption, the same way he did in \"Rain Man\". But \"Jerry Maguire\", as if Cameron Crowe, the director, was already aware of its viewers' expectations, is pleasantly surprising because the redemption comes right at the beginning.After a series of eye-opening incidents, one night, Jerry wakes up and has a sort of breakthrough illumination; he realizes that he wasted his life, by cumulating a generous quantity of clients (professional athletes) without taking time to understand them, to deal with them in a decent way. Struck by this rebirth of humanity, he writes an inspirational memo titled \"Things We Think But Do Not Say\". The memo elevates him into a sports management guru status except that he's the only one who seems to believe in his new humanistic theories \u0085 him, and a young accountant, Dorothy Boyd (Renee Zelwegger) who 'saw the light' through Maguire's inspirational words. And naturally, when Maguire is forced to leave the company, she's the only one who chooses to follow him, she's the kind of women who stand for her beliefs.Then, Jerry and Dorothy work together with the only client who stays, Rod Tidwell, a football player, smaller than average, flamboyant, truculent \u0085 maybe a little too much, and he's played by a scene-stealing (and Oscar-winning) Cuba Gooding Jr. And it's funny how Gooding seems to embody the trademarks of Tom Cruise's archetypal characters through his cockiness and exuberance, but that's part of his 'character', I mean within the movie. Tidwell believes he's a great man, and naturally behind him, there's a woman, his wife Marcee (Regina King) who keeps a vigilant eye on his career's evolution. She doesn't trust Maguire but she gives it a shot. Tidwell trusts him and stays out of loyalty. And Boyd genuinely loves him because she knows there's something good inside that man. Maguire is a good guy because good people believe in him, and it works the other way, too.Indeed, the 'friends' in the beginning, the pedant Bob Sugar (Jay Mohr) and Avery, not to mention the cocky football player named Cush (whom I just discovered, was the chubby Vern from \"Stand By Me\"), they all represent the dark side of Maguire's world, and it's only when he gets fired, when he leaves Avery and is betrayed by Cush' father who ends up signing with Sugar (leaving Tidwell as Maguire's only option), it's only when he's an outsider from that cynical world, that we start rooting for him. And Cruise is perfect because it's crucial that Maguire starts being unlikable enough so we can give him the benefit of the doubt and then supposedly change but not enough to make us lower our guard. The suspicion must remain whether he's a good or a bad guy, if he's going to make it because he believes in his ideas of if he's going to sell his soul back to the devil. It's a two- way process, Rod considers him a friend, not his wife. Dorothy loves him and so does her adorable little kid, Ray, but her sister (Bonnie Hunt) is perplexed. Well, we expect a happy ending, but it's all in the \"how\" and \"when\" it will happen. The film deals with human relationships with a powerful mix of cleverness suitable for a comedy drama and touching tenderness, incarnated by the beautiful Renee Zelwegger, in a breakthrough performance that should have earned her an Oscar nomination. She's so adorable, so unbelievably sweet, that she puts something new and unusual in romantic comedies: genuine, shameless, passionate and innocent love. There is something quite gutsy in the way Cameron Crowe's film tries to cover sports, character study, romance in one story, but the multi-layered format works because Jerry Maguire remains the center of gravity. Dorothy Boyd is a great character because she awakens the best out of Jerry and saves him from his own megalomania. Ironically, Jerry does the same with Rod, also blinded by his own ego too and obsession with money. The way the two stories interact transcends a lot of predictable elements, and even when it doesn't avoid some archetypal situations, the acting makes everything believable. We know that Maguire will get back to Dorothy, but the way it's handled never feels forced and insincere. Jerry listens to Rod who's got the greatest day of his career, and he's simply talking to his wife. Jerry knows he can be a great man, but only if behind him, there's a woman, not any woman: a 'great' woman.The film is notorious for having introduced many iconic lines in Cinema's Dictionary: \"show me the money\", \"you complete me\" and last but not least \"you had me at 'hello'\", a line that owes more to its awkwardness than romantic appeal. Interestingly, the romantic catchphrase was used in the American Film Institute's 100 Passions montage right after Nicholson's \"You make me want to be a better man\". And after watching \"Jerry Maguire\", I understood this is exactly why Dorothy Boyd was a great woman.","rating":8,"review_summary":"Behind every great man, there is a (great) woman ...","cleaned_review_text":"jerri maguir heartwarm romant comedi sport subplot sport drama romant underton fascin charact studi introspect profession privat life sport pro manag way two pole person influenc affect like third option especi sinc titl say film man name jerri maguireso who jerri maguir first strike kind charact tailormad tom cruis maguir guy who success busi privaci fact two world interact intens cant quit differenti friend colleagu client even fianc averi kelli preston exathlet tom cruis ultim yuppi play part perfectli extraordinari capabl make unlik enough better perceiv redempt way rain man jerri maguir cameron crow director alreadi awar viewer expect pleasantli surpris redempt come right beginningaft seri eyeopen incid one night jerri wake sort breakthrough illumin realiz wast life cumul gener quantiti client profession athlet without take time understand deal decent way struck rebirth human write inspir memo titl thing think say memo elev sport manag guru statu except he one seem believ new humanist theori young account dorothi boyd rene zelwegg saw light maguir inspir word natur maguir forc leav compani she one choos follow she kind women stand beliefsthen jerri dorothi work togeth client stay rod tidwel footbal player smaller averag flamboy trucul mayb littl much he play scenest oscarwin cuba good jr funni good seem embodi trademark tom cruis archetyp charact cocki exuber that part charact mean within movi tidwel believ he great man natur behind there woman wife marce regina king keep vigil eye career evolut doesnt trust maguir give shot tidwel trust stay loyalti boyd genuin love know there someth good insid man maguir good guy good peopl believ work way tooinde friend begin pedant bob sugar jay mohr averi mention cocki footbal player name cush discov chubbi vern stand repres dark side maguir world get fire leav averi betray cush father end sign sugar leav tidwel maguir option he outsid cynic world start root cruis perfect crucial maguir start unlik enough give benefit doubt supposedli chang enough make us lower guard suspicion must remain whether he good bad guy he go make believ idea he go sell soul back devil two way process rod consid friend wife dorothi love ador littl kid ray sister bonni hunt perplex well expect happi end happen film deal human relationship power mix clever suitabl comedi drama touch tender incarn beauti rene zelwegg breakthrough perform earn oscar nomin she ador unbeliev sweet put someth new unusu romant comedi genuin shameless passion innoc love someth quit gutsi way cameron crow film tri cover sport charact studi romanc one stori multilay format work jerri maguir remain center graviti dorothi boyd great charact awaken best jerri save megalomania iron jerri rod also blind ego obsess money way two stori interact transcend lot predict element even doesnt avoid archetyp situat act make everyth believ know maguir get back dorothi way handl never feel forc insincer jerri listen rod who got greatest day career he simpli talk wife jerri know great man behind there woman woman great womanth film notori introduc mani icon line cinema dictionari show money complet last least hello line owe awkward romant appeal interestingli romant catchphras use american film institut passion montag right nicholson make want better man watch jerri maguir understood exactli dorothi boyd great woman","label":0}

Usually, when I see one of the better ones, I can pinpoint exactly what I like about it. For Toy Story, it is the ability to relate to the characters. In Tangled, for instance, it was a story so sad you couldn't help but root for the protagonist. With Frozen, however, I can't put my finger on \"one reason\" why I liked it so much...it was kind of more of a \"package deal\".For a basic plot summary, Frozen tells the story of two sisters born of royal blood, Elsa (Idina Menzel) and Anna (Kristen Bell). While very close as young sisters, the women drift apart in adulthood after an accident in which Elsa's ice-creating magical powers hurts Elsa. Determined not to hurt anyone ever again, Elsa absconds the royalty and creates her own castle far into the wilderness. The only problem? She has left her hometown in a perpetual state of winter. As such, young sis Anna sets out to find Elsa and set things right, along the way meeting up with mountain-man Kristoff (Jonathan Groff) and snowman-come-to-life Olaf (Josh Gad).Like I said, there is no one thing about this movie that really makes it stand out compared to previous Disney efforts. It is just the combination of everything that make it such an enjoyable experience. The story is engaging, the characters are interesting, humor abounds, the visuals are astounding, and the music is enthralling. There never seems to be a lacking moment in the whole 104-minute spectacle.So, despite not being able to hang my hat on that \"one attribute\", Frozen is primarily such an enjoyable experience because it has a little bit of everything.

{"review_date":"6 September 2008","movie_id":"tt0086879","user_id":"ur12394529","is_spoiler":true,"review_text":"I found that the film was not at all as I expected- a staid Merchant-Ivory type production mixed with a hint of Masterpiece Theater. This was both good and bad. On the positive side is the very dramatic structure of the film, being told from Mozart's inferior rival's, Antonio Salieri's (F. Murray Abraham), point of view. On the down side is the over the top performance by Tom Hulce, as Mozart, especially with that pointlessly distracting guffaw. Also, as the DVD delineates which scenes were altered, extended, or added in toto, it becomes obvious that director Milos Forman's original cut was the superior, as none of the added scenes adds palpably to the thrust of the film. Yes, I liked the added scene of Mozart's wife, Constanze (Elizabeth Berridge), getting naked to try to sexually please Salieri, to advance her husband's career, for Berridge was certainly a major hotty with the body back then, but, despite my prurient interest, the scene is pointless\u0085. Unfortunately, in either version, this is nowhere near a great film. It's a fun, solid romp, but the American accents and slang that infiltrate Eighteenth Century Viennese society are just too much, as is Hulce as Mozart. No, a staid portrayal of the man would have been dull, but a genius as idiot savant, or a step above, is not worthy of this dramatic treatment, either. That it only heightens Salieri's frustration is dramatically defensible, but since the whole notion of Salieri's envy and hatred of Mozart is a historical fiction, there really was no reason to go so over the top in the first place.The rest of the cast does fairly well. Berridge as the clueless wife, Jeffrey Jones, as Emperor Joseph, is a dolt with a heart, who doesn't understand how to run his own life, much less a nation\u0085.All in all, I would recommend the film, but as a light diversion, not a serious inquiry in to art nor the artistic mindset.

There is something contagious about a good comedy in a packed cinema, a synergy that you don't always get at home.But herein lies the problem. Until now, I've watched The Inbetweeners by myself or with one other, and despite its extreme situations, is actually quite an intimate, personal & homely kind of comedy, a bit like Peep Show. So the packed screen was actually quite quiet. This makes it all feel a bit strange, like you're watching a TV programme, but with lots of people you don't know. On this occasion, the cinema doesn't really bring anything extra to the film, and you would actually be better off watching on DVD on a cosy Saturday night with pizza. Its crazy to think I could buy all three seasons of the show for less than the \u00a311 I stupidly paid for a luxury seat.The film itself - it is exactly like an extended episode of the TV show. Whilst the Christmas special of Extras seemed quite cinematic in its themes and story, The Inbetweeners really does just follow the same formula. In the incredibly sparse reviews, I had read that the film shows us the boys growing up, the tender tragedy of splitting apart before moving on in their lives. These themes are mentioned in very limited ways, sometimes just a line of dialogue, so don't expect any progression in the characters or their lives. Another minor gripe is that a large section of the story is devoted to Simon, the least funny or interesting character of the show in my opinion, whinging over Carly and being incongruently obsessed with getting back with her. Will's dry narration seemed more unfunny on the big screen, and it dawned on me that aside from the various set-ups and situations, most of the humour comes from Jay's wit and delivery of lines.Overall, it was funny, some great cringe moments, and plenty of typical awkward exchanges that characterise the show. Eventually though, its still just a light laugh, so don't expect anything more satisfying or thoughtful than a few back to back episodes of the TV show.","rating":6,"review_summary":"Yes its funny, but is it worth paying for?","cleaned_review_text":"reason thought worth go see rather wait dvd opportun share audienc someth contagi good comedi pack cinema synergi dont alway get homebut herein lie problem ive watch inbetween one despit extrem situat actual quit intim person home kind comedi bit like peep show pack screen actual quit quiet make feel bit strang like your watch tv programm lot peopl dont know occas cinema doesnt realli bring anyth extra film would actual better watch dvd cosi saturday night pizza crazi think could buy three season show less stupidli paid luxuri seatth film exactli like extend episod tv show whilst christma special extra seem quit cinemat theme stori inbetween realli follow formula incred spars review read film show us boy grow tender tragedi split apart move live theme mention limit way sometim line dialogu dont expect progress charact live anoth minor gripe larg section stori devot simon least funni interest charact show opinion whing carli incongru obsess get back will dri narrat seem unfunni big screen dawn asid variou setup situat humour come jay wit deliveri linesoveral funni great cring moment plenti typic awkward exchang characteris show eventu though still light laugh dont expect anyth satisfi thought back back episod tv show","label":0}

They walked out of the theater pining for a love like Gatsby and Daisy's.

I honestly was wondering what Luhrmann was condoning and what he was being critical of once this movie was over. Maybe it's all a pan and he was really just poking fun at us. Or maybe he really didn't think it through and had washed out the real story to even himself. I also found myself having nostalgia for the old 1974 version with Robert Redford and Mia Farrow, something I never thought was possible.

This is just the opposite sin, the materialist stance that views other people as a way to enrich your life without giving something back. This is not ugly racism, this is only class egoism. This would be the same with the same affluent WASPs having a paternalistic behaviour with poor whites (there are movies about this: Rich bored guy goes out to have fun with simple peasants then goes back to his comfortable condo with a year-worth of shrink realization). Only here WASPs have a very specific history of poaching on new frontiers and appropriating Black Culture.So yes, despite its strengths and original premise Get Out covers too much territory from horror to thriller, fantasy and social commentary.

The costumes, makeup and artistry in the film are excellent but cater to the teens as well.Most upsetting is that these Vampires would have had their butts whooped by any of the True Bloods or Bram Stoker's vamp.

Jane being played by Dakota Fanning, who will most likely use this paycheck to pay for further acting lessons. Of course, Stephenie Meyer wrote the 1st three books very well so I'm giving 5 stars for that (it's very difficult to mess this movie up with such good writing). I give 1 star for the make up and costumes. I give 0 stars for the Lifetime Channel dialogue between the teenage characters especially Kristen Stewart who is not acting but is just herself being overly dramatic at times.Of course, most everyone reading this is going to see the movie anyway but I at least state now \"You're not going to miss much!\" Read the book instead if you have not already.The next installment, Twilight Eclipse, will most likely have Teen Vampires from The Gap fighting Abercrombie & Fitch's Vamps!","rating":6,"review_summary":"New Moon, I give you a Full Moon!","cleaned_review_text":"dont know overli excit get true sneak peek new moon everyon els thrill disappear movi start like drink beer longer excit turn bring alarm clock movi start set minut fall sleep wake bella edward moo goo googoo bore banter begin get slightli entertain thatalic one brighten screen cute act goodnew moon offer twilight fan expect written teenag especi teen girl love movi costum makeup artistri film excel cater teen wellmost upset vampir would butt whoop true blood bram stoker vamp even lost boy make newmoon look like lost girl wolf boy kind tough vamp movi realli weakth volturi introduc new moon movi jane play dakota fan like use paycheck pay act lesson cours stepheni meyer wrote st three book well im give star difficult mess movi good write give star make costum give star lifetim channel dialogu teenag charact especi kristen stewart act overli dramat timesof cours everyon read go see movi anyway least state your go miss much read book instead alreadyth next instal twilight eclips like teen vampir gap fight abercrombi fitch vamp","label":0}

He seems to be a rebellious kid (foreground for his future adulthood) and dislikes his foster parents. After Terminator I, his mom, Sarah has been institutionalized.The Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) shows up and so does The T-1000 (Robert Patrick). For the ten minutes or so that you see them, you think who the hell is Robert Patrick? Is he another resistance member? Nope! This time Arnold is the good guy and Robert is the bad guy. The catch is Robert's type of Terminator is advanced. He's a liquid metal type which allows him to shape shift. Arnold becomes friends with John and tries to teach him things, but inevitably their relationship ends.Linda Hamilton reprises her role as Sarah Connor. There is basically no known supporting cast. But it isn't needed as the four main characters are enough.The special effects were increasing at an incredibly fast rate when the 1990's started so that's the reason why the special effects for the 1991 Terminator film are better than the 1984 Terminator film.The story was much more interesting and the action was a lot more exciting. The special effects were ten times better and the cast was great. Not to mention, Arnold had an actual role aside from walking and shooting. He spoke a lot.The dialogue was cheesy at times but the action makes up for all the flaws in this film. And, thank god, they didn't try to throw another stupid, unwanted love story in this one like they did with the first. Anyone with 1\/3 of a brain can easily figure out that this movie easily surpasses the original Terminator for more than five reasons. There is not many sequels that beat the original but this one does.Don't get me wrong, I love Arnold and I love Terminator series but I hate the original.

The story is fantastically paced and well written to ensure the audience doesn't get lost. Not only does Whedon manage to provide closure for the show in a heart-tugging and effective way, he also manages to leave the door open for a sequel (but not in one of those painfully blatantly obvious ways). He answers many fan prayers by exploring the Reavers in great depth, providing plenty of character development and generally making it great fun. Laughs are plenty (though the movie is much, much darker than the show was).From a directing standpoint, the movie was a success. The action scenes are sharp, and well-shot. The movie has so many different types of action to convey, from shootouts, to swordfights, to space battles to your regular beat-em-up. All work perfectly on screen, and the sharp and unexpected cuts get more than a few jumps from the audience.The acting is simply fantastic. For a movie with no \"big-names\", and being an unusually large ensemble, the characters are portrayed exceptionally well. Nathan Fillion provides a very strong lead to the crew, Summer Glau plays River with grace and fantastic skill and Chiwetel Ejiofer is simply stunning as the villainous Operative.The music too is sheer quality. Many of the Western elements from the show remain here (moreso than the actual movie) with carefully crafted compositions and instrumental styles unheard of in modern action movies.Serenity is a creative success. It is intelligent, sharp, witty and visually spectacular. I can only hope the movie will perform strongly at the box office, but no matter how well its does - it deserves even more. Serenity is the movie the Star Wars prequels could only hope to be.Rating: *****","rating":9,"review_summary":"The finest picture to grace cinema screens this decade.","cleaned_review_text":"bigscreen debut joss whedon doesnt fail impress either role writer director stori fantast pace well written ensur audienc doesnt get lost whedon manag provid closur show hearttug effect way also manag leav door open sequel one pain blatantli obviou way answer mani fan prayer explor reaver great depth provid plenti charact develop gener make great fun laugh plenti though movi much much darker show wasfrom direct standpoint movi success action scene sharp wellshot movi mani differ type action convey shootout swordfight space battl regular beatemup work perfectli screen sharp unexpect cut get jump audienceth act simpli fantast movi bignam unusu larg ensembl charact portray except well nathan fillion provid strong lead crew summer glau play river grace fantast skill chiwetel ejiof simpli stun villain operativeth music sheer qualiti mani western element show remain moreso actual movi care craft composit instrument style unheard modern action moviesseren creativ success intellig sharp witti visual spectacular hope movi perform strongli box offic matter well deserv even seren movi star war prequel could hope berat","label":1}

Her children are suddenly told that they have a brother and a father who are still living, and that they are to deliver a secret letter to each of them on her behalf. This situation is succinctly communicated in a very effective opening scene of exposition, and indeed the difficult search of these young adults to find their lost relatives remains the central focus throughout the entire film. A niggling weak point of many critically-acclaimed European films is a frustrating ambiguity in storytelling and a lack of a properly paced narrative, both of which seem to have a certain sadistic purpose about them, as if the intention is to make things as hard for the audience to follow as possible. However, the early firm grounding of plot present here assists greatly with the accessibility, and so is far less discriminative.The scenes making up the body of the piece proceed mostly with a masterful grace, coherence, intrigue and sophistication. The sister, Jeanne Marwan (M\u00e9lissa D\u00e9sormeaux-Poulin) is by far the more willing of the two to carry out their mother's dying wishes \u0096 her brother, Simon (Maxim Gaudette) merely responds with a moody male temper to the words in the will \u0096 and so, at least initially, we follow Jeanne, being shown extended flashbacks of the events from her mother's past that she discovers. In these scenes, we see Mrs Nawal Marwan fighting endlessly to survive in a world fraught with terror and violence, being the horrific religious and political conflicts in the Middle East of the 1970s. The challenges she faces make this one of those remarkably engrossing and poignant stories of hope bravery and love that are cinematic gold.The final discoveries and revelations are again satisfyingly comprehensible, but definitely not for the faint-hearted viewer. Still, even if one finds the overall conclusion distastefully grotesque, there is still something to admire in the most apt direction from Denis Villeneuve and a splendid performance from Lubna Azabal as the mother. With a cast that also includes R\u00e9my Girard, Allen Altman, Mohamed Majd and Abdelghafour Elaaziz, Incendies (\"Scorched\") may have the occasional patch of sluggishness and over-exaggeration, but you still owe it to yourself to see it.","rating":8,"review_summary":"Not perfect, but unmissable!","cleaned_review_text":"two teenag sibl make funer arrang prematur deceas mother faith notari inform peculiar request left complet burial children suddenli told brother father still live deliv secret letter behalf situat succinctli commun effect open scene exposit inde difficult search young adult find lost rel remain central focu throughout entir film niggl weak point mani criticallyacclaim european film frustrat ambigu storytel lack properli pace narr seem certain sadist purpos intent make thing hard audienc follow possibl howev earli firm ground plot present assist greatli access far less discriminativeth scene make bodi piec proceed mostli master grace coher intrigu sophist sister jeann marwan mlissa dsormeauxpoulin far will two carri mother die wish brother simon maxim gaudett mere respond moodi male temper word least initi follow jeann shown extend flashback event mother past discov scene see mr nawal marwan fight endlessli surviv world fraught terror violenc horrif religi polit conflict middl east challeng face make one remark engross poignant stori hope braveri love cinemat goldth final discoveri revel satisfyingli comprehens definit faintheart viewer still even one find overal conclus distast grotesqu still someth admir apt direct deni villeneuv splendid perform lubna azab mother cast also includ rmi girard allen altman moham majd abdelghafour elaaziz incendi scorch may occasion patch sluggish overexagger still owe see","label":1}
{"review_date":"24 August 2017","movie_id":"tt0145681","user_id":"ur19733576","is_spoiler":true,"review_text":"Despite its failure to impress the critics, \"The Bone Collector\" became a big box office success because of its intriguing plot, its likable characters and the public's continuing fascination with serial killers. Its plot, which was adapted from Jeffery Deaver's novel of the same name, features a cat and mouse game that involves a brilliant forensics expert and a sadistic serial killer who takes pleasure in taunting his pursuers by leaving clues at the scenes of his crimes As these clues provide leads to where and when the next murder will take place, the police find themselves in a constant race against time as they desperately try to discover the identity of the killer and bring his reign of terror to an end before any more people are needlessly killed.Lincoln Rhyme (Denzel Washington) is the forensics expert who, during his career with the NYPD, became highly respected for his ability to solve cases by using his exceptional skills. Having been bedridden for four years (since he was crippled by a beam that accidentally fell on him), his depression has grown so deep that he's started to arrange his own \"final transition\" with the aid of a friend who's agreed to assist with his suicide. Rhyme regularly suffers seizures and his greatest fear is that one of these will leave him in a vegetative state.Although he says that he only has the use of one finger, his shoulders and his brain, he also has some sophisticated computer equipment which he puts to good use in his work. Because of the high esteem in which he's held by the NYPD, he's been kept on the payroll and is regularly asked to help out on their more challenging cases. Just such a case arises when a patrol cop called Amelia Donaghy (Angelina Jolie) discovers a dead body buried under gravel beside some train tracks and collects various pieces of evidence that are lying nearby.When the evidence and Amelia are brought to Rhyme's Manhattan apartment, he's very impressed by the young street cop's work and insists that she should help him with his further investigations because she obviously has a natural instinct for forensics work. After overcoming her initial reluctance to pass up on the desk job that she's due to transfer to imminently, Rhyme and Amelia start to work together. Rhyme quickly deduces from the available evidence, the identity of the killer's next victim and the likely location of the murder. Amelia then assists by examining the site and acting as Rhyme's eyes and ears as he gives her instructions through her headset. Rhyme's deductions are proved to be correct and the evidence that Amelia collects at the crime scene, makes it evident that they're dealing with a serial killer and that he's following a set modus operandi. This continues until, chillingly, the evidence found at one of the crime scenes points to Rhyme being the next victim.\"The Bone Collector\" is an entertaining psychological thriller that's particularly enjoyable because of its two main stars and the way in which they work together so well. Denzel Washington overcomes the problem of his character being permanently immobile by the sheer quality of his performance and Angelina Jolie, in her first starring role, makes the changes that Amelia goes through in her work and her relationship with Rhyme seem very natural and convincing. The supporting cast is also good with Luis Guzman providing most of the humour.","rating":7,"review_summary":"Intriguing, Enjoyable & Well-Acted","cleaned_review_text":"despit failur impress critic bone collector becam big box offic success intrigu plot likabl charact public continu fascin serial killer plot adapt jefferi deaver novel name featur cat mous game involv brilliant forens expert sadist serial killer take pleasur taunt pursuer leav clue scene crime clue provid lead next murder take place polic find constant race time desper tri discov ident killer bring reign terror end peopl needlessli killedlincoln rhyme denzel washington forens expert career nypd becam highli respect abil solv case use except skill bedridden four year sinc crippl beam accident fell depress grown deep he start arrang final transit aid friend who agre assist suicid rhyme regularli suffer seizur greatest fear one leav veget statealthough say use one finger shoulder brain also sophist comput equip put good use work high esteem he held nypd he kept payrol regularli ask help challeng case case aris patrol cop call amelia donaghi angelina joli discov dead bodi buri gravel besid train track collect variou piec evid lie nearbywhen evid amelia brought rhyme manhattan apart he impress young street cop work insist help investig obvious natur instinct forens work overcom initi reluct pass desk job she due transfer immin rhyme amelia start work togeth rhyme quickli deduc avail evid ident killer next victim like locat murder amelia assist examin site act rhyme eye ear give instruct headset rhyme deduct prove correct evid amelia collect crime scene make evid theyr deal serial killer he follow set modu operandi continu chillingli evid found one crime scene point rhyme next victimth bone collector entertain psycholog thriller that particularli enjoy two main star way work togeth well denzel washington overcom problem charact perman immobil sheer qualiti perform angelina joli first star role make chang amelia goe work relationship rhyme seem natur convinc support cast also good lui guzman provid humour","label":1}

This is certainly the best MI yet and perhaps the best movie of the year so far, alongside Fury Road, at least for me.But well, let's get down to it. I'm glad Cruise choose McQuarrie to helm this one, because despite some backlash, I liked his directorial debut \"Jack Reacher\" and he really elevated the film to an whole new level with his directing chops.Then, we have Cruise. He is just great! A Jack of all trades, I mean, he can act, he can do his stunts, he produces, he takes risks. He is simply a showman. And in this one, he steals it all. He does such a great job that I now consider him one of my favourite performers. Simon Pegg is given the comic relief of the movie, although the whole cast surprised because of the comic scenes and their comic timing. I believe that the humour was enhanced by McQuarrie's script but the ensemble cast made a great job nailing this scenes. But after Cruise's performance the standout for me was Rebecca Fergunson.

A surprise!Ving Rhames and Jeremy Renner return and Alec Baldwin is introduced to the series as the CIA's director Huntley.

It's big, bold and full of protein for lovers oft the genre. From the lively villain to the unbelievable stunts to the set pieces, it's a tough package to beat. A stunning, vertigo inducing opener set high atop a snowy peak that ends in tragedy. A breathtaking airial heist carried out between two planes via cable wire. A whopper of a helicopter crash. Countless bone snapping, visceral hand to hand combat scenes. The list goes on. Sylvester Stallone puts his physique to great use as Gabe Walker, a rock climbing mountaineer guide who is accidentally responsible for the falling death of his best friend's girlfriend. His buddy Hal (Michael Rooker) blames him no end, and he leaves in personal disgrace. Elsewhere, ruthless backstabbing psychopath Eric Qualen, (John Lithgow) leads a team of dangerous mercenaries through aforementioned heist, plundering millions from a US treasury department plane and disappearing into the snowy desolation. Soon they come across Hal and a group of people touring the region, who are soon hostages. Word somehow gets out to Stallone and he's back in business, out for redemption and then chance to brutally dispatch this gang of snow pirates. The action, refreshingly absent of digital gimmicks, packs one hell of a punch. Every fight scene feels breathless, dangerous and desperate. Every blow is thunderously felt, courtesy of director Harlin's commitment to his work and the efforts of a stellar stunt team. Stallone isna beast and I forget that every time I haven't seen him in a while. He's almost as big as the mountains he scales here and each and every bad guy damn well finds this out. Rooker is as intense as he always is, love the guy. Lithgow is a freaking villain for the ages, in a role intended first for David Bowie, then Christopher Walken. I'm glad the ball ended up in his court, because he subsequently knocks it back out of the park with his cold blooded, deliciously evil performance. He makes Qualen so scary and merciless that even his own people get the jitters around him. There's also work from Rex Linn, Caroline Goodall, Craig Fairbrass, Max Perlich, Paul Winfield, Ralph Waite, Don S. Davis, Bruce McGill and Janine Turner. This is just one of the finest action movies to ever swing into theatres or onto DVD. Brutal, scenic, adventurous, exciting, violent, snowy, just plain kick ass.

Depp came across as an effeminate, slapstick, goof-ball captain as opposed to a seasoned sea dog.The comedic devices used throughout were EXTREMELY trite and low brow and make Beavis and Butthead and the Keystone Cops look sophisticated by comparison. The level of humor in the Shrek series, for example, appeals to a much larger audience base than does DMC's. One example is the whole scene with the cannibals running down the beach after the pirates and then running back up the beach after the dog. The entire segment was literally slapstick and exceedingly juvenile in nature. It falls on its face when compared, for example, to the similar scene of Indy Jones running away from the natives and into the airplane at the beginning of Raiders of the Lost Ark.Even the scene with the dice game was a bust. It could have been very tense and suspenseful given fates were literally hanging in the balance. Instead, it came across as anticlimactic given it was hard to follow the progress of the intended \"suspense\" as the number of 5's, 4's, etc. were wagered and rolled.The scene with the dirt and the heart was inexcusably lame given this was what we were supposedly building up to and waiting on for the entire 2 1\/2 hours. Naturally, the inept Depp drops and breaks the jar (whoops!) on the deck of the ship. But, given this is fantasy, what are we supposed to even be expecting will happen given its an \"immortal\" heart, magic dirt in a jar, etc.? Will Davey Jones die once the heart is placed in the dirt? Evidently not. Does the heart have to remain in the dirt for a period of time first before whatever happens happens? Well, the jar broke so we don't know if it was in there \"long enough\" to take effect. The heart evidently fell into the ocean when the boat sank so does that mean anything regarding Davey's immortality? Dunno. When Davey opens the chest and finds his heart isn't in there he seems disappointed, but evidently unaware that the magical heart-in-dirt process had taken place so evidently the event hadn't even fazed him. The entire premise, despite being the focus of the entire movie, is simply dropped, unaddressed, and unresolved (yes, I understand there's a 3rd movie).The bottom line is that there is no true drama or suspense, no true comedy, and a lack of intuitive logic about the entire movie. Instead, the appeal appears to be for the fancy costumes, nifty special effects, sex appeal of the primary actors, etc. without a shred of anything else that makes a movie entertaining for those out of grammar school.What a disappointment given all the hype.","rating":1,"review_summary":"a tediously-long, dull movie lacking anything for those over age 12","cleaned_review_text":"hour way much alreadi look watch minut regret id gotten hour would suffici easili attain due numer pointless scene didnt contribut plot axedth movi lack seriou intrigu tone point entir cast pranc spongebob adventur topic hand oppos true pervas pirat theme depp came across effemin slapstick goofbal captain oppos season sea dogth comed devic use throughout extrem trite low brow make beavi butthead keyston cop look sophist comparison level humor shrek seri exampl appeal much larger audienc base dmc one exampl whole scene cannib run beach pirat run back beach dog entir segment liter slapstick exceedingli juvenil natur fall face compar exampl similar scene indi jone run away nativ airplan begin raider lost arkeven scene dice game bust could tens suspens given fate liter hang balanc instead came across anticlimact given hard follow progress intend suspens number etc wager rolledth scene dirt heart inexcus lame given supposedli build wait entir hour natur inept depp drop break jar whoop deck ship given fantasi suppos even expect happen given immort heart magic dirt jar etc davey jone die heart place dirt evid heart remain dirt period time first whatev happen happen well jar broke dont know long enough take effect heart evid fell ocean boat sank mean anyth regard davey immort dunno davey open chest find heart isnt seem disappoint evid unawar magic heartindirt process taken place evid event hadnt even faze entir premis despit focu entir movi simpli drop unaddress unresolv ye understand there rd movieth bottom line true drama suspens true comedi lack intuit logic entir movi instead appeal appear fanci costum nifti special effect sex appeal primari actor etc without shred anyth els make movi entertain grammar schoolwhat disappoint given hype","label":1}

Everyone knows about Star Wars and it's memorable cast of characters, like the young Luke Skywalker(Mark Hamill), the tough Princess Leia(Carrie Fisher), the scoundrel Han Solo(Harrison Ford), the wise old man Obi-Wan Kenobi(Alec Guinness), the hairy wookie Chewbacca(Peter Mayhew), the two droids C-3PO(Anthony Daniels) and R2-D2(Kenny Baker), and lastly, the best of them all, Darth Vader(David Prowse). With such a large cast, they are they hit or miss? They, obviously, are a hit and every one of them gives such a performance people will remember them decades later. This movie was so great, that it's seventh cannon film, The Force Awakens(2015), had quite a few elements from the original which translated well now as it did then. Though, there are some inconsistencies I've notice particularly with the acting. One example is with Princess Leia where one moment she'd have a British accent, then it changes to another accent. Also sometimes Luke can have laughably awkward acting moments, that can almost be considered on the level on what George Lucas did later on with Anakin in the prequels. And, from time to time their are some lines that you might not remember, or stick to you; they can be presented not that great. But for a majority of it, there are several quotable and memorable lines in this film, though even more is found in it's superior sequel: The Empire Strikes Back(1980). Overall, this film is timeless and will always be remembered and watched by it's incredibly strong fan base.

Then i noticed that the movie is only an hour and a half, so that kind of brought down my expectations. Usually movies that short are comedies whose plots are just awful but always give a good laugh or two, so i was preparing myself for the worst.The disappointing thing about the movie is that they didn't really build up the characters or go into detail with them. They briefly went over who they were and instantly went into talking about the alien invasion. The overall idea of the movie was actually really interesting. I liked the whole brain swap thing, not to mention the rebuilding of the ship when it got nuked. It showed that yes the human race isn't always more dominate and clearly they are much stronger then us. The action in the movie was pretty lame too since you didn't normal see anyone fight back and everyone was hiding, which i guess is realistic. Unlike other movies where people magically find weapons and fight back. However it bored the movie down a bit. If they picked up a better writer for the movie and actually took their time to develop the movie it could have been much more interesting.Even though there are ton of disappointing things in this movie, there are a few parts i actually enjoyed. The first was seeing Jarrod becoming a tank and just getting super strength somehow caused by the blue light. Another scene where the big fight happened and the air force nuked the alien ship. In the ending scene, where Jarrod becomes an alien but can control his body. That scene made me think, why is his brain the only one that can control these aliens? Why did it shine orange and not blue like the others? Also what will he do now. The ending by far was my favorite part and what made the movie average for me. Again if they made the movie longer it would have been a more intense ending scene. Clearly this movie didn't score so hot and they left the ending for perhaps a sequel. However i def wouldn't mind seeing the sequel. Overall it was watchable, it wasn't a movie as good as district 9 or independence day, but it had chance to be if they worked on it more. ***Spoilers End***If they made the movie longer it would have been a more intense ending scene.

I had mild interest in classical music until this movie showed me the great appreciation. I hated Opera until this movie came along. What about the setting? So beautiful. Each scene is like a painting itself. One very haunting and sad yet beautiful scene at the same time I thought was a transition from Leopold crumbling of the letter to the scrambling frighten deers.Abraham & Hulce gave those two musicians forceful identities. Abraham's performance is so passionate. Though I haven't seen the play, I doubt anyone can imitate Hulce's laugh so wickedly. Wonderful direction was done by Milos Forman. Peter Schaffer's writing is purely great theater, mixed with comedy and great imagination. Who cares if much of it is fiction. Also kudos needs to be given to the stage choreography Twyla Tharp who is known in the Broadway world.The only drawback was that I was so spoiled by the near perfection of the theatrical version, I became so nitpick on the editing in the director's cut.

A child growing up who suffers periodic blanks in his memory when parts of his and his friends' lives take very traumatic turns. Unfortunately, after Evan found out a way to remedy all this by using his diaries, it goes downhill from there. His efforts seemed very compulsive, clumsy, and sloppy with little forethought, which might be understandable for the first couple of time jumps but frankly gets old after a while. Every change made screws up more and more of his life preventing him from fixing the previous mistakes he made as he is no longer able to write the diaries from that point on. Finally, at the end, unlike in the movie \"Groundhog Day\", he just plain gives up (in both the theatrical and director's cut).The director's cut, while probably more in the spirit of this dark, depressing film, was even worse than the theatrical, not only because of the ending but also the creepy fortuneteller and sickening political correctness. You could think of that version as the ultimate twisted antithesis of \"It's a Wonderful Life\".I mean, come on. Life isn't a bowl of cherries, but it isn't a bowl of offal either. If everyone thought the way the directors of this movie did, the human race would be doomed to extinction. And if you're trying to simply send the message that messing around with time can change the future in ways you don't want, the body of the movie did that in spades, making the failed ending unnecessary.

Instead, I can say the plot has too many flaws to rank this a must-see film.  We have seen this story before, done much better.  The performances were flat.  The only real performance might be Vincent D'Onofrio, but even he couldn't save the film.Jennifer proves once and for all that her a** is hers and not surgically altered. Many people will see it for that few seconds at her refrigerator.The film has been described as a cross between Matrix and Silence of the Lambs.  That might be said, although I heard fellow movie-goers saying a few other films bred into the screenplay.  Fact is, if you are looking for Silence or Matrix, go and rent them, because this falls short of the mark.After my negative comments, let's look at why I was generous enough to give rehashed plot and characters a 7 out of 10.  The visual imagery is simply stunning, beyond compare.  What the plot and actors lack, the sets more than make up for.  This is a film made for the big screen!  See it in the theater.  DVD isn't even quality enough for this.  Experience it in the theater at least once.Check your brain at the door and just enjoy the colors, bright, dark, emotional.  The cinematography is the real film, not the shoddy story along with it.Spoilers!!!!  Warning, do not read if you do not want to know more...Shoddy detective work by the FBI is simply disappointing.  The whole film pins the detective work on a woman entering a serial killer's mind to find a woman we barely care about.  She is never given much of a soul to make us care if they find her alive or not.  What agent would see a strange piece of machinery, which is obviously part of the mutilation chamber in the killer's home and no one is working on checking that angle until said detective \"goes into\" the killer's mind to save the well experienced child psychologist from remaining trapped.  Then, like a revelation, he sees the symbol from the machinery in the killer's mind and connects it to the real world, calls his people to find the manufacturer.  In the 30 plus hours they had to crack into the killer's brain, the FBI still hadn't finished setting up a grid in the killer's tiny home and no one had bothered to examine the cellar, where they found the incriminating video.  Instead, the FBI had focused on the messy, tiny attic for the grid.The little boy - his father is wealthy and the boy is found on a seal island in a coma.  Why tell us any of that?  Why introduce his parents for 2 minutes and introduce a possible bad relationship between the kid's father and Lopez, then never examine either thing?I feel that Singh has a brilliant career ahead of him if only he can find a more polished screenwriter than Protosevitch, who also might have a career if he puts his own thoughts on his own stories rather than churning out bad imitations of other original screenplays.We already know Lopez has a glorious career ahead of her.  Between modeling, acting, and singing, we will be seeing her for years.  She needs to be more careful about script control.  This character could have been more interesting, but again that falls on a poor writer.  At least she isn't acting with snakes anymore.Vin D'Onofrio needs more vehicles to show his talents.  Certainly, when the bio of Stephen King is made, he should get the role!Vince Vaughn has potential, but also needs to screen his roles more in the future, selecting the best vehicle to display his acting ability.Jake Weber, as usual, plays it low-key, barely noticeable by most movie-goers.

{"review_date":"18 January 2003","movie_id":"tt0078748","user_id":"ur1095226","is_spoiler":false,"review_text":"Alien is a definitive experience. Just thinking back at the difficulties one had to face when approaching a genre which is nowadays filled with CGI, makes the feeling of admiration just surges within me. Despite the fact that we get the same main element, the alien, the stories change. This first movie, as usually the most important of the whole series, is certainly a milestone for all horror and sci-fi films.I would like to be able to tell the story from an objective point of view, but I consider it quite hard, as this type of movie, the horror type, is a disputed one. Each person can decide if it will or will not view such kind of movies. It is hardly probable that a person who does not like horror movies, will like this one. For one thing, horror movies will never win a major academy award, as they do not have what ALL people want to see. But if you want to be entertained, then this type of movie can get it on for you. Sci-Fi and Horror will always ring a scream in my head: Alien.SpoilersThe story is simple at the beginning...sometime in the future, a cargo ship detects a signal from a planet, and it awakes the crew to check on what it might be. Until the chosen ones get to the planet we get a strange, but scary atmosphere. The planet itself is most obviously against the presence of human life, as the conditions are unfavorable(this will not be the same in Aliens though...does humanity win? Or does that planet really represent the end of human life? We don't get to know that, but when something looks wrong...it usually is wrong). The alien ship stands like a great colossus between the rocks of the horrid planet, and once inside, the unknown attacks. One crew member is infected by what is called a \"face hugger\". A creature with acid instead of blood, with a great defensive system which spawns the worst nightmare of Ellen Ripley.There will be scenes which will make you jump and tremble, and the movie will keep you connected to the terrible events which happen on the Nostromo.Alien exploits the fear of the unknown at its best, from the darkness of space to the alien within poor Kane, from the intimacy of being lost in space to the fear of mega-corporations, to claustrophobia, to solitude, to betrayal. It's all here, all encapsulated in one of the greatest films ever made. And such a world would not be complete without the beast itself.All the things which relate to the evolution of the alien creature are brilliantly thought of. It has more phases of evolution, some phases in which it is truly vulnerable, yet it has the ability to survive, like any animal. Evolved instincts, great strength and a beastly intelligence...it could almost be something from our world. The fact that makes it different is the capacity to kill with ease humans - jolly! The most impressive thing about it is its looks: a fantastic design coming from the bizarre mind of Hans Rudi Giger, inspired - as a matter of fact - by his nightmares! Sigourney Weaver is the actress which will always be the symbol of \"Alien\". I guess it took you some time to guess that one right, didn't it? Well, as always, the story of getting a classic role is filled with near-misses and false impressions. But life has its way of making things right, in such a manner that it always leaves you thinking: it couldn't have been any other way. When it actually could have. Ridley Scott did a great job creating this universe with such a low budget, and he deserves most of the applause. He created one of the most terrific movies I have ever seen, with great horror scenes and great filming. His love for details made Alien what it is today - a huge mausoleum of horror, the wannabe result of any horror movie maker. Sinful in several ways by todays standards - slowly paced and lacking in terms of heavy action - Ridely Scott's film wins by defying them. A master at work can always be recognized.","rating":9,"review_summary":"Horror","cleaned_review_text":"alien definit experi think back difficulti one face approach genr nowaday fill cgi make feel admir surg within despit fact get main element alien stori chang first movi usual import whole seri certainli mileston horror scifi filmsi would like abl tell stori object point view consid quit hard type movi horror type disput one person decid view kind movi hardli probabl person like horror movi like one one thing horror movi never win major academi award peopl want see want entertain type movi get scifi horror alway ring scream head alienspoilersth stori simpl beginningsometim futur cargo ship detect signal planet awak crew check might chosen one get planet get strang scari atmospher planet obvious presenc human life condit unfavorablethi alien thoughdo human win planet realli repres end human life dont get know someth look wrongit usual wrong alien ship stand like great colossu rock horrid planet insid unknown attack one crew member infect call face hugger creatur acid instead blood great defens system spawn worst nightmar ellen ripleyther scene make jump trembl movi keep connect terribl event happen nostromoalien exploit fear unknown best dark space alien within poor kane intimaci lost space fear megacorpor claustrophobia solitud betray encapsul one greatest film ever made world would complet without beast itselfal thing relat evolut alien creatur brilliantli thought phase evolut phase truli vulner yet abil surviv like anim evolv instinct great strength beastli intelligenceit could almost someth world fact make differ capac kill eas human jolli impress thing look fantast design come bizarr mind han rudi giger inspir matter fact nightmar sigourney weaver actress alway symbol alien guess took time guess one right didnt well alway stori get classic role fill nearmiss fals impress life way make thing right manner alway leav think couldnt way actual could ridley scott great job creat univers low budget deserv applaus creat one terrif movi ever seen great horror scene great film love detail made alien today huge mausoleum horror wannab result horror movi maker sin sever way today standard slowli pace lack term heavi action ride scott film win defi master work alway recogn","label":0}

{"review_date":"12 June 2004","movie_id":"tt0118929","user_id":"ur1078990","is_spoiler":true,"review_text":"Words can't begin to describe the admiration that I have for this movie. Even to this day, six years after seeing it for the first time, I can't get over the freshness, originality, and overall boldness of Alex Proyas' visionary masterpiece. Now that Proyas is getting a larger budget for I, Robot this year, I felt that it would be time to credit Proyas' earlier science fiction masterpiece in anticipation that I, Robot would only live up to this film. From the opening shots of this film, the viewer is instantly plummeted into a bold and grand setting of an indistinct city that seems that this is how noir films of the forties would look if they were in color. After a display of the bizarre occurrence that happens to the city around midnight, we are introduced to the film's protagonist, a man named John Murdoch, who awakens in a bathtub, with no memory of his life or how he got where he was. Needless to say, what happened to the dead woman next to his bed. After a few clues that seem to trigger brief glimpses of his childhood, he is chased from his room by three odd looking figures, looking for him.As Murdoch wanders the city, trying to find his identity, we learn that not only are the strange people (who are appropriately named The Strangers) looking for Mr. Murdoch, but a police officer named Bumstead is as well, searching for the killer of not just the woman in the apartment, but six other women who were murdered in the same manner as the woman from Murdoch's room. Also is Murdoch's estranged wife, who is trying to make a reconciliation with him after a falling out. Even a therapist that Murdoch has been seeing because of his wife's infidelity is searching for him as well. Everyone seems to have their own reason to be searching for Murdoch, and Murdoch is trying to figure out why, since he has no clue as to who he is. In a sense, Murdoch's quest becomes a search for identity in a world that is trying to label him. Is he a murderer, is he a jilted lover, is he psychologically damaged person, or is he a like the strangers who are pursuing him?But that becomes the center question of Dark City itself, do we make up who we are or are we made up of experiences and memories? We realize this question when we realize the purpose of the Strangers' inhabitance of the city. They are actually aliens, whose race is dying out and they need to observe the human race to see what has made us thrive so much. So, we enter their experiment, which revolves around making the inhabitants of the city fall asleep at midnight while the strangers give them new lives by implanting new memories in them and changing the environment around them.Murdoch also discovers that the reason the Strangers are coming after him is because he has developed an immunity to the experiment, not falling asleep when everyone else does. He has also begun to take on the traits of the strangers as well, gaining their power to \"tune\", which is the ability to alter their environment by will alone. This whole concept suggests two things, the first being that humanity has the ability to adapt and thrive in a new environment and the other is that as an individual, humans have the ability to shape their world to their own desire once they are fully aware of themselves and their desires.The movie in itself is a brilliant commentary on our society as a whole which is displayed in the beginning with Dr. Schreber's rat experiment in the lab, which comes to symbolize a smaller scale version of the strangers' experiment for us, putting rats (humans) in a maze of a city (life) and seeing if they can find their way. Which also seems to suggest that as a society, we are merely just rats in a maze, wandering around until we come to the end. The strangers' insistence on doing everything as a group also brings up another interesting point about the human race is that our ability to be individuals is what makes humans thrive rather than conformity and similarity. \"Dark City\" takes such bold and brilliant concepts, suggesting so much about our society as a whole and even the importance of individuality over conformity. The themes, once read into, take on such a strong and complex turn, unheard of in most science fiction films of recent years.Then there is the matter of the setting itself, for no science fiction film can be complete without a strong and symbolic setting. The setting is vast and detailed, and this isn't just the city, which is a sight to behold in itself. The underground world of the strangers themselves is claustrophobic, atmospheric, and actually is the most alien in architecture, suggesting a twisted, surrealistic world, yet one that is dependent on the world above them. The city above ground displays a rich noir feel in which one feels that there is something sinister lurking underneath it's surface. Even the blending of the time periods, seeing 30s architecture around 60s cars driven by people in 50s suits is even a hint off that the city has been fabricated out of different eras and pasts as one of the strangers even seems to suggest.\"Dark City\" is a film rich in ideas, concepts, visual splendor, and atmosphere. It's the kind of film that one seems to enjoy being lost in, despite the danger that lurks in it's atmosphere. It's a film that reassures it's viewers that a strong understanding of oneself and staying true to yourself that one can conquer any world they are placed in. And as I, Robot approaches, one can only hope that lightning can strike twice with Proyas and his unique blend of visual grandeur and his depth will emerge and be embraced by a larger audience, who might seek out this film.","rating":10,"review_summary":"One of the Best Movies Ever Made","cleaned_review_text":"word cant begin describ admir movi even day six year see first time cant get fresh origin overal bold alex proya visionari masterpiec proya get larger budget robot year felt would time credit proya earlier scienc fiction masterpiec anticip robot would live film open shot film viewer instantli plummet bold grand set indistinct citi seem noir film forti would look color display bizarr occurr happen citi around midnight introduc film protagonist man name john murdoch awaken bathtub memori life got needless say happen dead woman next bed clue seem trigger brief glimps childhood chase room three odd look figur look hima murdoch wander citi tri find ident learn strang peopl appropri name stranger look mr murdoch polic offic name bumstead well search killer woman apart six women murder manner woman murdoch room also murdoch estrang wife tri make reconcili fall even therapist murdoch see wife infidel search well everyon seem reason search murdoch murdoch tri figur sinc clue sens murdoch quest becom search ident world tri label murder jilt lover psycholog damag person like stranger pursu himbut becom center question dark citi make made experi memori realiz question realiz purpos stranger inhabit citi actual alien whose race die need observ human race see made us thrive much enter experi revolv around make inhabit citi fall asleep midnight stranger give new live implant new memori chang environ around themmurdoch also discov reason stranger come develop immun experi fall asleep everyon els also begun take trait stranger well gain power tune abil alter environ alon whole concept suggest two thing first human abil adapt thrive new environ individu human abil shape world desir fulli awar desiresth movi brilliant commentari societi whole display begin dr schreber rat experi lab come symbol smaller scale version stranger experi us put rat human maze citi life see find way also seem suggest societi mere rat maze wander around come end stranger insist everyth group also bring anoth interest point human race abil individu make human thrive rather conform similar dark citi take bold brilliant concept suggest much societi whole even import individu conform theme read take strong complex turn unheard scienc fiction film recent yearsthen matter set scienc fiction film complet without strong symbol set set vast detail isnt citi sight behold underground world stranger claustrophob atmospher actual alien architectur suggest twist surrealist world yet one depend world citi ground display rich noir feel one feel someth sinist lurk underneath surfac even blend time period see architectur around car driven peopl suit even hint citi fabric differ era past one stranger even seem suggestdark citi film rich idea concept visual splendor atmospher kind film one seem enjoy lost despit danger lurk atmospher film reassur viewer strong understand oneself stay true one conquer world place robot approach one hope lightn strike twice proya uniqu blend visual grandeur depth emerg embrac larger audienc might seek film","label":1}

Largely excepted to be one of the greatest films of all time, and The Dark Knight belongs right there with them. The Dark Knight trilogy as a whole is untouched by the marvel cinematic universe, and The Dark Knight is the untouched movie in the trilogy. This is a superhero movie that redefined Batman and the genre. Personally, growing up watching Batman, I've always wanted a more realistic one compared to Tim Burton's. This was a superhero genre, along with crime and drama. We see the fall of Harvey Dent, and a man who has no care of the world other than to watch it burn. You clearly see the inspirations from the graphic novels like, \"The Long Halloween,\" \"Dark Victory,\" and of course, \"The Killing Joke.\" The irony of Gotham's true hero, Harvey Dent, lived long enough to see himself become the villain. The joker, he pushed everyone to their limits, he wanted to make everyone have just \"one bad day\" like the Joker in the graphic novel, \"The Killing Joke.\" It is a story of Shakespearean proportion. To those who rate this movie a criminally underrated 1-7, are just joking yourself and clearly trying to die down the hype. Take a rain check, nine years later this movie still best the super hero genre, and it's simply because it is more complex than the genre itself. That is why it belongs as one of the best films ever made. Also, if you're still confused, and argue that Iron Man is better than the Dark Knight because they both have 94% on rotten tomatoes, look more closely. It's average rating is a 7.7\/10, while The Dark Knight's average rating of 8.6\/10 on rotten tomatoes.

{"review_date":"30 May 2014","movie_id":"tt0118617","user_id":"ur24931284","is_spoiler":false,"review_text":"As a kid the unsolved mystery of Anastasia always fascinated me, it was much like with the Elvis sighting stories because of the possibility of what if. It made me wonder what if somehow Anastasia did survive and was still alive, may'be she lost her memory and doesn't know or she choose not to be found. Despite the fact this mystery has been solved recently in 2007, it didn't delude the mystery that fascinated me so much, because questions and the possibilities we draw up are most of the time what we thrive on in life than the answers themselves.This film is one of my favorite animated films that I personally think is under the radar.The animation by one of my favorite if underrated animated directors Don Bluth is top notch in my book as usual. Like the livelihood of the movement, the background animation is great capturing both 1900s Russia and Paris beautifully. But mainly I like the character designs which make them stick out.The music is just beautiful, the songs are excellent and memorable. Two of my favorites are \"At the Beginning\" which is a romantic song. However my favorite song is \"Journey to the Past\" which is just beautiful and has a range of emotion because it's simply about Anna's journey to find her past to find home.But to me it's the story and characters that power this film.I really like the story, like with the film \"Bubba Ho Tep\" it plays on the what if concept of Elvis still alive. This film is pretty much a fairy tale but in a contemporary reality which I don't see much, except may'be in the TV show \"Once Upon a Time\".The antagonists are solid, Rasputin (voiced well by Christopher Lloyd one of my favorite actors and voice actors)he's a villain you love to hate as he has some really good lines. He's pretty much just simply a power hording psycho that is just bent on getting power in the worst possible way.I even like the subordinate villain Bartok voiced by one of my favorite voice actors and underrated actor \"Hank Azaria\" (yeah for the record I'm a Simpsons fan) he's just a fun and cute antagonist you don't hate, he's just fun and funny has some of the best lines. He's sort of a villain for hire, doesn't care about his boss's cause or even his boss himself; he's just a person (or bat) that is just doing what he's paid to do but also has enough common sense to walk away.I really like the protagonist Anastasia (voiced well by Meg Ryan), she's beautiful inside and out, she's got charisma, sweet, but also really feisty, can hold her own against danger, but most of all just has this unwavering hope that she will find something in her life to make her whole, which all the more makes her someone we want to bet on to win because after what she's been though she deserves it. But she's a character you do feel a slight sense of pathos for as she's simply a person that is lost and is in need of home and love in her life. From what we already know of her past it's actually really sad, since most of her family has been deceased for some time which means she literally has no home to come back to and the fact she can't remember them very well is awful. Personally I feel what she's really looking for isn't so much the past, but it's really her own destiny, it's not so much just a home she's wants but her own life to be able to create and call someplace home.Demetri (voiced well by John Cusack an actor I like) is my favorite character in the film because he's a protagonist but an unconventional one. He's sort of like the last guy you really would bet on to save the day, he's obviously not perfect but sometimes these kinds of protagonists are the best kind let alone interesting. He's the kind of guy that looks out for number one, is wanting to get rich quick despite breaching ethical boundaries, and he's a bit of a user. He's kinda funny, he's got some sharp charisma which means he got some of the best lines. But to me what makes this character likable is thought the journey and his time with Anna he does grow in character and does the right thing.I really like the chemistry between both Anna and Demetri, this is one of those romances that actually work as both interact and warm up to one another which I think is believable. I even like that dance scene between them which was sweet. We then see as Anna is gaining some happiness in her life again, Demetri is beginning to change his mind about the scheme and he not just is beginning to discover the true identity of Anna but is having genuine feelings for her, which makes him realizes that there really are more things more important than money and it's not what he really needed after all.In a way you can say this is a story of redemption for the character as he's had a shady past that he himself isn't proud of, by completing the mission to return and protecting Anna he may also have a home of his own as well, since he himself just like Anna is without a home and love. Both were in pursuit of different things but were really in pursuit of each other.Overall this I feel is a great animated film that like any great mystery is worth uncovering.Rating: 4 stars","rating":10,"review_summary":"Journey to the Past","cleaned_review_text":"kid unsolv mysteri anastasia alway fascin much like elvi sight stori possibl made wonder somehow anastasia surviv still aliv mayb lost memori doesnt know choos found despit fact mysteri solv recent didnt delud mysteri fascin much question possibl draw time thrive life answer themselvesthi film one favorit anim film person think radarth anim one favorit underr anim director bluth top notch book usual like livelihood movement background anim great captur russia pari beauti mainli like charact design make stick outth music beauti song excel memor two favorit begin romant song howev favorit song journey past beauti rang emot simpli anna journey find past find homebut stori charact power filmi realli like stori like film bubba ho tep play concept elvi still aliv film pretti much fairi tale contemporari realiti dont see much except mayb tv show upon timeth antagonist solid rasputin voic well christoph lloyd one favorit actor voic actorsh villain love hate realli good line he pretti much simpli power hord psycho bent get power worst possibl wayi even like subordin villain bartok voic one favorit voic actor underr actor hank azaria yeah record im simpson fan he fun cute antagonist dont hate he fun funni best line he sort villain hire doesnt care bosss caus even boss he person bat he paid also enough common sens walk awayi realli like protagonist anastasia voic well meg ryan she beauti insid she got charisma sweet also realli feisti hold danger unwav hope find someth life make whole make someon want bet win she though deserv she charact feel slight sens patho she simpli person lost need home love life alreadi know past actual realli sad sinc famili deceas time mean liter home come back fact cant rememb well aw person feel she realli look isnt much past realli destini much home she want life abl creat call someplac homedemetri voic well john cusack actor like favorit charact film he protagonist unconvent one he sort like last guy realli would bet save day he obvious perfect sometim kind protagonist best kind let alon interest he kind guy look number one want get rich quick despit breach ethic boundari he bit user he kinda funni he got sharp charisma mean got best line make charact likabl thought journey time anna grow charact right thingi realli like chemistri anna demetri one romanc actual work interact warm one anoth think believ even like danc scene sweet see anna gain happi life demetri begin chang mind scheme begin discov true ident anna genuin feel make realiz realli thing import money realli need allin way say stori redempt charact he shadi past isnt proud complet mission return protect anna may also home well sinc like anna without home love pursuit differ thing realli pursuit otheroveral feel great anim film like great mysteri worth uncoveringr star","label":0}

He's even nicknamed \"Hollywood's new prodigy\". So three years after \"Rushmore\", he released a new movie: \"The Royal Tenenbaums\" (2001).This movie's got a whacky script (the Tenenbaums are all gifted) full of zany ideas and powerful cues: \"he's not your father\" says Gene Hackman to Gwyneth Paltrow about Danny Glover, \"Neither you\" she replies. But this on the level of the directing that Anderson's talent shines: it turns out to be inventive, clever and we can notice that he favors two devices: static shots and tracking shots. Moreover, it's obvious that Anderson put a lot of effort into the esthetic side of the movie: bright colors have been used on the sceneries and they're enhanced by a luminous photography. With all these advantages, \"The Royal Tenenbaums\" is a movie full of light and life.But in parallel, I thought that the performances were of varying quality: if Gene Hackman and Ben Stiller dominate the cast, on the other hand, Anjelica Huston and especially Gwyneth Paltrow make the movie a bit dull. Besides, her wild look annoyed me during nearly all the movie. I preferred her in \"the talented Mr Ripley\" (1999). Moreover, given that she's a playwright, could she be Max Fischer's distant cousin? (Max Fischer was the hero of \"Rushmore\" and in his spare time, he wrote plays too).Then, I think I didn't understand one sequence: this is the last one when all the members of the Tenenbaum family are gathered to attend Hackman's funeral. What do they feel? Happiness? Sadness? Indifference? Wes Anderson doesn't really reveal us the members' feelings about this dramatic event.Although, I don't really regard Wes Anderson as a genius,I'm obliged to recognize that he's got talent to produce movies which can be both funny and wit. So, once again: \"the royal Tenenbaums\", a good movie? Definitely. A masterpiece? No.","rating":6,"review_summary":"break up the family...","cleaned_review_text":"sinc critic commerci success rushmor we anderson becam promis talent director he even nicknam hollywood new prodigi three year rushmor releas new movi royal tenenbaum movi got whacki script tenenbaum gift full zani idea power cue he father say gene hackman gwyneth paltrow danni glover neither repli level direct anderson talent shine turn invent clever notic favor two devic static shot track shot moreov obviou anderson put lot effort esthet side movi bright color use sceneri theyr enhanc lumin photographi advantag royal tenenbaum movi full light lifebut parallel thought perform vari qualiti gene hackman ben stiller domin cast hand anjelica huston especi gwyneth paltrow make movi bit dull besid wild look annoy nearli movi prefer talent mr ripley moreov given she playwright could max fischer distant cousin max fischer hero rushmor spare time wrote play toothen think didnt understand one sequenc last one member tenenbaum famili gather attend hackman funer feel happi sad indiffer we anderson doesnt realli reveal us member feel dramat eventalthough dont realli regard we anderson geniusim oblig recogn he got talent produc movi funni wit royal tenenbaum good movi definit masterpiec","label":0}

Shoot in a way I didn't expect, the talk to the camera angle with a lot of the main characters, but it's necessary to understand all the bank-talk. They added a little comedy with all the celebrities explaining to us whats what, instead of having the characters do all the explaining in random conversations. Amazing performances by Christian Bale and Steve Carell, especially the ending scenes where they in financial numbers kinda won, but in the real battle against the big banks they didn't stand a chance. The big guys on the top of the chain won and let the workers take the fall, which is a disgrace and the government did almost nothing after the biggest fraud of financial history took place. I feel like this review is more about the story than the movie, but it's such an incredible story and they did manage to get a great movie out of it. The movie includes a lot of talking, so you have to pay attention and subtitles are recommended to keep track. A great story, told in a good way, with a gallery of stars in the main roles makes this one of the best movies of 2015.

{"review_date":"1 September 2010","movie_id":"tt0477348","user_id":"ur12394529","is_spoiler":true,"review_text":"The film, as shown above, is often called a thriller or Gothic, but neither term really applies. It's not Gothic because it is too tied to the earthen landscape, and it's barely a thriller, because, well, it's so predictable. It's simply a monster movie- a bit more realistic than the Hannibal Lecter\/Freddy Krueger sort, but not much. One wonders what the film would have been like if the assassin Chigurh had been more like the hit-man character played by Forest Whitaker in Ghost Dog: The Way Of The Samurai, Jim Jarmusch's underrated film about an assassin, which is also one of the most realistic depictions of organized crime on film. R, perhaps he could be more erratically real, like Johnny Boy, Robert De Niro's psychotic character from Martin Scorsese's Mean Streets, another realistic depiction of organized crime. Instead, what does Chigurh offer besides The Terminator and The Joker? Yes, another Batman foe, Two-Face's obsession with coin flipping to decide whether or not he commits murder. Perhaps in his construction of the novel, McCarthy thought that this device was somehow deep or profound, that it lent Chigurh the status of cosmic force of nature, but what it really did was explicitly tie the character down to a comic book level realism. And, incidentally, Two-Face was played by Jones in 1995's Batman Forever.But, to get back to the point I raised, the film is SO predictable. Do we not know how Chigurh's victims will end up? Do we not know that he will escape at the end, despite the bone of the car crash tossed in to make it seem like cosmic justice will out? Do we not know Moss is a dead man? That is wife is also a walking corpse? That Sheriff Bell will prove as incompetent as he is apathetic? And, I earlier mentioned the overrated Thomas Paul Anderson film, There Will Be Blood, but since both films so posture themselves on 'depth' in dealing with their amoral characters, it's a wonder why so few critics took these films to task for never truly delving into that amorality. Great, amoral characters- see Films, Slasher (20th Century). Yawn. Yet, of the two films, and even laden with its own considerable flaws, it still has some occasionally interesting moments wrought by the acting abilities of Daniel Day-Lewis (although that film's lead character is not amongst his best). Is there a single character in this film with a fifth of the complexity of Lewis's Daniel Plainview, even considering how thin that character is developed? No. Simple. No. And that is the same answer to give to the query over whether this film is worth rewatching.On to the DVD features. There are three disks- one to download a digital copy onto one's PC (thanks, I'll pass), then the disk with the film. Unfortunately, it lacks an audio commentary. One of the prime things a DVD has in its favor, as a mode of visual art, is the ability to feature commentaries on films, and barring a Woody Allen-like decision yo always forego such, it is incumbent upon DVD companies to include such, especially to supplement mediocre films like this. The disk also has a good making of featurette, a film on working with the Coen Brothers, and a small piece on Tommy Lee Jones' character. The final disk has a bevy of features: a tongue in cheek featurette shot by Josh Brolin, and a slew of clips regarding the promotion of the film over several months- from interviews to book store appearances to radio interviews. All in all, a decent bonus features package. But, the lack of audio commentary is glaring.As for the film itself, on the technical side, the cinematography by Roger Deakins is solid to good. At times the views of West Texas are very Antonionian, whereas, at others, little is made of perspective, framing, and editing. Carter Burwell's scoring leaves no impression, one way or the other. The acting is rather pedestrian- from the stilted Bardem to the so laid back he's barely acting Jones to the solid Brolin. And, as I opened this essay by stating, some things are better excerpted. This film's trailer is proof, for it is engaging, unlike the film. The last 15 or so minutes of the film, after Moss's death, are utterly superfluous, for they add nothing to the plot, which is the primum mobile of the film. The film would have been much better had its rather incisive portrayals of small town Texans and their quirks been given more screen time, and then a reduced scenario of the drug chase, with more realistic characters, were added to that brew. But, alack, this might require work, and thought, and too often, in Hollywood (including the vaunted Coen Brothers) these sorts of things simply cannot be bothered with. Instead, the small time characters flit in and out of this film with such rapidity that they are lucky that a few of them rise above stereotypes. Fair enough, I guess, if you consider film a business first. I consider it an art first, so be equally fair and give the Coens the same in return as they gave to their screenplay: don't bother with their film. After all, your time and money are as precious as any film investor's.

His own quest for vengeance becomes tied in with romance when he falls for an attractive sushi chef (Gang Hye-Jung), who feeds him live octopus and who may or may not be involved with the bizarre mystery.

General Brigham (Brendan Gleeson) orders him to the front lines. Cage doesn't want to go and even threatens the General who then strips Cage of rank, demoting him to private. Afterwards Cage is taken in handcuffs to Master Sergeant Farell (Bill Paxton) who gets him familiar with his new squad. The next day they mobilize for a massive operation, in which Cage is killed, but Cage doesn't stay dead, instead he wakes up being introduced to Master Sergeant Farell all over again. The next time Cage finds himself on the battlefield he meets Rita (Emily Blunt) who had the same problem. Together they compare notes and find a new way to strike at the enemy.Character DevelopmentCage generally makes a complete turn to who he was at the beginning of the picture to where he ends up, yet the emotional reward is just not there with the Cage (Tom Cruise) like it was with Phil (Bill Murray) in \"Groundhog Day\" (1993). I think the character General Brigham was right when he called what was happening all around him \"one big trick\".ActingThough there were a few tender moments, this wasn't the place for much in the way of acting and much more time was utilized in reacting and stunt work. The points in this story were it slowed to lay some emotion was in my opinion a mistake where the two leads were made to touch lips, which seemed out of character and out of place on the battlefield.OverviewAt times this story was very entertaining. There is no getting around that fact though that this was another version of \"Groundhog Day\" (1993). The only difference was in this movie the story here tried to find a rational explanation to why the protagonist was reliving the same day over and over again. And like \"Groundhog Day\" (1993) Tom Cruise's character demonstrates his godlike powers of knowing everything about everyone around him. What I found disappointed about this film was how it seemed to get stuck switching gears. One minute it a series of living and dying and the next it tea time in the farmhouse. The pace was definitely off at times. Yet the action and special effects seemed to be working well, only I thought the alien moved with such incredible speed it just didn't appear to be realistic. Out of all the thought and planning that went into the production of this film the designs of the alien race had to be the weakest element. All the world's nations unite to fight them and there is nothing to see. Just a bunch of downed human aircraft and soldiers. What is the enemy using to knock our stuff out of the sky?

And Leterrier doesn't try not to provide action junkies plenty of action- smashing moments as we root for Bruce Banner to hulk up, unfortunately of course, to satisfy our lust for some unadulterated action where everything in the way of the Hulk, gets smashed. However those expecting action from the get go will be disappointed, as there were only a small handful of action sequences, though of course they include the classic moments that comic fans had been baying for since 4 years ago. So I guess most will be left happy as we see some nifty moves by the Hulkster, which will leave a smile on your face, despite being used in limited doses. But I note though that the story cum action, looked a little bit like Superman II with the seeking of a cure and the deliberate loss of power to be with the lady love, and the duking out between super-beings on equal footing (here being gamma-powered), with a tinge of Cloverfield like moments too.While there will be those who will gripe about the transformation mainly done in the dark and in shadows, it does prove to be effective in building some anticipation and heigntened tension as to when he will finally appear in full glory. The mainly military attacks on the big guy again brought out some back to basics adversary with Thunderbolt Ross trying to capture the Hulk, and in fact I'd appreciate that this movie didn't divert too much away from this primary objective, although it might be more of the same from the first movie. But while the Hulk has an aura of invulnerability, somehow The Incredible Hulk provided me at least, an emotional pang when he gets hurt bad, as we remember that this is a guy who just plainly wants to be left alone. And the angrier the Hulk gets, the bigger and more powerful he becomes too.And it's not all serious here too, with well meaning humour peppered in the right places, making numerous references to the television series and characters from the Marvel universe. You'd often wonder how his pants stay on before-during-and-after transformation, well, it gets addressed here with humour. Memorable ines such as \"don't- make-me-angry-you-wouldn't-like-me-when-I'm-angry\" gets punned away, even the late Bill Bixby got a cameo, together with Lou Ferrigno who reprises his security guard role, and Stan Lee who's possibly in the most unmemorable cameo appearance ever. The much touted Tony Stark appearance will bring whoops of joy from newly converted fans of Robert Downey Jr, while I suspect in line with the rumoured Avengers movie, the universe now seemed more streamlined again with the references to SHIELD, and stupid me thinking that Mr Fantastic would somewhat be featured in this too. A WWII super soldier project and serum was referenced and formed the basis for Tim Roth's Emil Blonsky turned Abomination, but Captain America? I'll leave that to you to find out.But what I really liked about The Incredible Hulk is not the action sequences, nor the references mentioned made. It was the central love story between Bruce Banner and Betty Ross. In Lee Ang's version, we don't see much of the romance between Bana and Connelly because the story didn't really call for it, save for a rescue scene, and at an in-juncture where the Hulk was stopped in his tracks by his lady love. And that was precisely the winner for me. The Hulk, for all his power and unstoppable rage, could be brought under control by his lady love, and that was used to great effect here. Beneath the green invulnerability lies the heart of a mild-mannered man who yearns to be with the love of his life, but unfortunately cannot due to the curse that Fate had brought upon him. Both Norton and Tyler managed to bring out this chemistry of lovers torned apart, one who can only admire the other from afar, and the other finally never wanting to let go of someone who had disappeared from her life for her own protection. And this version of Betty does sport a bit of a temper and feisty too, and is not really your classic damsel in distress.Granted that most supporting characters were rather one-dimensional, The Incredible Hulk somehow managed to straddle between its intense whack-all-destroy-all moments, and tender ones when the lovers are left alone to their own devices. As with the Marvel movies to date, the doors are left wide opened for follow ups and team-ups, and here there are no less than three avenues where the next story could develop further from, and sowed the seed for other movie franchises to be developed too. It drained a little bit from the cerebral department in order to amplify the romance, and let the action go into overdrive. HUlk Smash indeed, this time likely to make a huge dent at the box office, for fans and non-fans alike to be won over, just like how Iron Man did.","rating":9,"review_summary":"A Nutshell Review: The Incredible Hulk","cleaned_review_text":"crowd street clutter hous street rio de janeiro provid reminisc jacki chan polic stori could sure chase scene zig zag street take advantag wonder opportun present exhilar chase leterri doesnt tri provid action junki plenti action smash moment root bruce banner hulk unfortun cours satisfi lust unadulter action everyth way hulk get smash howev expect action get go disappoint small hand action sequenc though cours includ classic moment comic fan bay sinc year ago guess left happi see nifti move hulkster leav smile face despit use limit dose note though stori cum action look littl bit like superman ii seek cure deliber loss power ladi love duke superb equal foot gammapow ting cloverfield like moment toowhil gripe transform mainli done dark shadow prove effect build anticip heignten tension final appear full glori mainli militari attack big guy brought back basic adversari thunderbolt ross tri captur hulk fact id appreci movi didnt divert much away primari object although might first movi hulk aura invulner somehow incred hulk provid least emot pang get hurt bad rememb guy plainli want left alon angrier hulk get bigger power becom tooand seriou well mean humour pepper right place make numer refer televis seri charact marvel univers youd often wonder pant stay beforeduringandaft transform well get address humour memor ine dont makemeangryyouwouldntlikemewhenimangri get pun away even late bill bixbi got cameo togeth lou ferrigno repris secur guard role stan lee who possibl unmemor cameo appear ever much tout toni stark appear bring whoop joy newli convert fan robert downey jr suspect line rumour aveng movi univers seem streamlin refer shield stupid think mr fantast would somewhat featur wwii super soldier project serum referenc form basi tim roth emil blonski turn abomin captain america ill leav find outbut realli like incred hulk action sequenc refer mention made central love stori bruce banner betti ross lee ang version dont see much romanc bana connelli stori didnt realli call save rescu scene injunctur hulk stop track ladi love precis winner hulk power unstopp rage could brought control ladi love use great effect beneath green invulner lie heart mildmann man yearn love life unfortun due curs fate brought upon norton tyler manag bring chemistri lover torn apart one admir afar final never want let go someon disappear life protect version betti sport bit temper feisti realli classic damsel distressgr support charact rather onedimension incred hulk somehow manag straddl intens whackalldestroyal moment tender one lover left alon devic marvel movi date door left wide open follow up teamup less three avenu next stori could develop sow seed movi franchis develop drain littl bit cerebr depart order amplifi romanc let action go overdr hulk smash inde time like make huge dent box offic fan nonfan alik like iron man","label":0}

In the cartoon Uncle Iroh was a fat, humorous man. In the movie he was thin and somewhat serious. In the beginning of the movie Sokka and Katara were the only Caucasians, everyone else were Eskimos. Not only were races an issue for me, but the pronouncation of names were a problem as well. \"Aang\" was pronounced \"Awng\", \"Iroh\" was pronounced \"E-roh\", \"Agni kai\" was pronounced \"Agni key\", \"Sokka\" was pronounced \"Sohka\", this became confusing and irritating to me. The last thing that disappointed me was the delivery of the story. It was too quick in the movie. They should've just made two separate movies. I really think that the director should make dramatic changes to the incoming movies.

{"review_date":"8 June 2008","movie_id":"tt0499448","user_id":"ur12709264","is_spoiler":true,"review_text":"WARNING: LOTS OF SPOILERS in my review! Skip it if you don't want the movie spoiled for you.Here goes: First and foremost, I thought this film lacked the magic of the first. The first one had this magical Christmas-y feel to it I could keep watching it on DVD without getting tired of it.Prince Caspian started out okay but I found myself hoping the Pevensies would show up on screen soon and when they did, I felt a smile creep up my face. Some things weren't explained well. I often found myself explaining some scenes to my friends and my family, whom I watched with, because none of them read the book. But then, I didn't read the book thoroughly either.The new film was alright. I thought the battle sequences were really cool (from the view point of a person who does not know much about war tactics and strategy). I thought the use of some of the old score was great! It made the Prince Caspian feel more connected to the first movie.The special effects weren't as good as the first one, or at least, I think so. The animated creatures seemed more \"animated\" than \"real\". Reepicheep reminded me of Puss-in-Boots in the Shrek movies. The audience in my theatre found the mouse endearing though.I read that some scenes like the Night Raid was added into the film (not part of the book) but I thought that added scene was great and the ending of that scene was wonderfully acted by William Moseley.It was certainly nice to see all the actors mature - looks-wise and personality-wise, especially Georgie Henley (who plays Lucy).There was a lot of humor in this film, compared to the first one. I definitely loved that.Two things that kept going through my mind though were: (1) I never thought I'd want to cry during a Narnia movie. First the end of the Night Raid scene. Then, the ending - with that song, The Call by Regina Spektor. It was strange having a song like that in a film that took you to another world but I fell in love with the song. The ending left me sad though. I tried to laugh when Edmund said he left his new torch in Narnia but my laugh seemed forced. I didn't have the light, happy feeling I got after seeing the first film but that didn't bother me so much.What bothered me more was that (2) Skandar Keynes (who plays Edmund Pevensie) was underused! I thought he could do more than just be in the background and have a few lines. I noticed that the other kids got a fair share of close-ups except for him. There was one scene - when the kids approached the Stone Table. Each Pevensie got a close-up. Then, when Edmund's character was about to get one then the camera panned away immediately. Edmund is my favorite character in LWW and I always wanted to see more of him. I'd have to say though. His scenes were the most memorable for me. There's something about him (and I can't explain what or why) that makes me notice him over the others when he's on-screen.Over-all, I thought this movie was good. Not as breathtaking at first but still great all the same. I must've liked it so much since I watched it twice and I still want to go see it a third time. So, I gave it an 8\/10!","rating":8,"review_summary":"Definitely not as magical as the first but still enjoyable!","cleaned_review_text":"warn lot spoiler review skip dont want movi spoil youher goe first foremost thought film lack magic first first one magic christmasi feel could keep watch dvd without get tire itprinc caspian start okay found hope pevensi would show screen soon felt smile creep face thing werent explain well often found explain scene friend famili watch none read book didnt read book thoroughli eitherth new film alright thought battl sequenc realli cool view point person know much war tactic strategi thought use old score great made princ caspian feel connect first movieth special effect werent good first one least think anim creatur seem anim real reepicheep remind pussinboot shrek movi audienc theatr found mous endear thoughi read scene like night raid ad film part book thought ad scene great end scene wonder act william moseleyit certainli nice see actor matur lookswis personalitywis especi georgi henley play lucyther lot humor film compar first one definit love thattwo thing kept go mind though never thought id want cri narnia movi first end night raid scene end song call regina spektor strang song like film took anoth world fell love song end left sad though tri laugh edmund said left new torch narnia laugh seem forc didnt light happi feel got see first film didnt bother muchwhat bother skandar keyn play edmund pevensi underus thought could background line notic kid got fair share closeup except one scene kid approach stone tabl pevensi got closeup edmund charact get one camera pan away immedi edmund favorit charact lww alway want see id say though scene memor there someth cant explain make notic other he onscreenoveral thought movi good breathtak first still great mustv like much sinc watch twice still want go see third time gave","label":1}

{"review_date":"4 May 2016","movie_id":"tt0316654","user_id":"ur62906690","is_spoiler":false,"review_text":"Spiderman 2 is directed by Sam Raimi and once again stars Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker, a nerdy kid attending college in New York. However, he's secretly a superhero as well, a hero that calls himself \"Spiderman.\" After the accidental death of his last villain, the Green Goblin, the tension between Peter and his best friend, Harry, has heightened, and the connection between Peter and his love interest, Mary Jane has begun to feel uneasy. Once a new villain called Doctor Octopus has presented himself, Peter must balance his life as a superhero and a college kid while keeping his relationships intact.Spiderman 2 is one of those rare sequels that improves upon the already amazing first film. Most everything in Spiderman 2 is great in most ways, and stands as one of the best superhero films to date. With a great villain, script, and perfectly well-rounded main character, Spiderman 2 is everything it promised to be. Sam Raimi handles this movie pleasantly, and not only built upon the first installment in the franchise, but improved upon it as well.The confliction of the main character, Peter, is absolutely flawless. Constantly throughout the film, the script beats Peter, and the audience, over the head with his problems. His failing relationship with Mary Jane, his inability to hold a job or keep grades up, the constant feel of tension between Peter and Harry, and the new villain on the rise, Doctor Octopus, all combine to make Peter's life completely awful. As the audience, we feel these conflicts through our main character, and subsequently want him to come out on top even more than before seeing the film. This capability to emotionally feel what the main character is what makes any protagonist, whether it be Spiderman or Han Solo, great.The acting, as well, is fantastic. Tobey Maguire, while not exactly improving upon his performance in Spiderman (2002), again does pretty well. Maguire plays a great Peter, and a decent Spidey, which add together for an ultimate success. James Franco plays an even better Harry this time around, improving upon his original performance in every way. Once again, Kirsten Dunst plays a pretty good Mary Jane. While her performance is fine, the character of Mary Jane starts to feel almost like an antagonist throughout the movie. Through her shaky connection with Peter, the audience is, at first, confused with her actions, and then just starts to get slightly annoyed with her character.Despite all of the great performances throughout Spiderman 2, Alfred Molina completely steals the show, playing a magnificent Doctor Octopus. Although Willem Dafoe's Green Goblin\/Norman Osborn was great, Molina's performance slightly tops that of Dafoe's. Molina plays an astounding villain, with an understandable motivation and a sensible plan. Doc Ock isn't just a bad guy for sake of being a bad guy; he makes sense. The viewer understands why he does the things he does, and won't take him for granted at all. From his actions to his lines, Alfred Molina's Doc Ock is one of the best superhero villains in cinematic history.Sam Raimi also handles the direction very well. Throughout the entire film, no action is filmed poorly, with no quick or abundant cuts, and great wide shots of Spidey swinging around the city. However, Raimi knows when to cut down on the \"cool\" shots and such during a talking or exposition scene. He smartly recognizes when the camera shouldn't be taking over for the script, and it pays off greatly. Although he utilizes his traditional \"Raimi\" camera angles, it works out well, and doesn't distract at all from the plot and characters.Now, I can't write a review of Spiderman 2 without mentioning the train sequence. The train sequence involves Spidey and Doc Ock fighting on a moving train, and it's easily one of the best action sequences in superhero film history. Everything about this sequence is absolutely perfect, and it works in every way. This particular sequence combines the genres of comic book and action so flawlessly, and it works perfectly.The only issue I took up with Spiderman 2 was a small one, but it is present. It is very hard to explain without spoilers, but it is this: Peter's problems are large throughout this film, and it's obvious. However, one of his specific problems is only halfway present. The problem is existent, but it disappears when convenient. Like mentioned above, hard to say without spoilers, but there it is.Spiderman 2 is one of the greatest superhero films ever created, and slightly improves upon its predecessor. I'd recommend Spiderman 2 to anyone who enjoys action and drama wrapped together in one movie.","rating":9,"review_summary":"Perfect Mix Between Action, Superhero, and Drama","cleaned_review_text":"spiderman direct sam raimi star tobey maguir peter parker nerdi kid attend colleg new york howev he secretli superhero well hero call spiderman accident death last villain green goblin tension peter best friend harri heighten connect peter love interest mari jane begun feel uneasi new villain call doctor octopu present peter must balanc life superhero colleg kid keep relationship intactspiderman one rare sequel improv upon alreadi amaz first film everyth spiderman great way stand one best superhero film date great villain script perfectli wellround main charact spiderman everyth promis sam raimi handl movi pleasantli built upon first instal franchis improv upon wellth conflict main charact peter absolut flawless constantli throughout film script beat peter audienc head problem fail relationship mari jane inabl hold job keep grade constant feel tension peter harri new villain rise doctor octopu combin make peter life complet aw audienc feel conflict main charact subsequ want come top even see film capabl emot feel main charact make protagonist whether spiderman han solo greatth act well fantast tobey maguir exactli improv upon perform spiderman pretti well maguir play great peter decent spidey add togeth ultim success jame franco play even better harri time around improv upon origin perform everi way kirsten dunst play pretti good mari jane perform fine charact mari jane start feel almost like antagonist throughout movi shaki connect peter audienc first confus action start get slightli annoy characterdespit great perform throughout spiderman alfr molina complet steal show play magnific doctor octopu although willem dafo green goblinnorman osborn great molina perform slightli top dafo molina play astound villain understand motiv sensibl plan doc ock isnt bad guy sake bad guy make sens viewer understand thing wont take grant action line alfr molina doc ock one best superhero villain cinemat historysam raimi also handl direct well throughout entir film action film poorli quick abund cut great wide shot spidey swing around citi howev raimi know cut cool shot talk exposit scene smartli recogn camera shouldnt take script pay greatli although util tradit raimi camera angl work well doesnt distract plot charactersnow cant write review spiderman without mention train sequenc train sequenc involv spidey doc ock fight move train easili one best action sequenc superhero film histori everyth sequenc absolut perfect work everi way particular sequenc combin genr comic book action flawlessli work perfectlyth issu took spiderman small one present hard explain without spoiler peter problem larg throughout film obviou howev one specif problem halfway present problem exist disappear conveni like mention hard say without spoiler isspiderman one greatest superhero film ever creat slightli improv upon predecessor id recommend spiderman anyon enjoy action drama wrap togeth one movi","label":0}

Here is the creator of Dog Day Afternoon and Wise Guys, a man considered one of the best of the 1970's Golden Age of Film, but film by film his stuff gets more over produced, less insightful, and more expensive. I saw it coming with Gangs of New York, but somebody keep Leonardo DiCaprio away from this guy. They are awful together and The Aviator is one big expensive, good-looking bore without a soul.In a documentary on Neo-Realism, Italian Post War Cinema, Scorsese claims he started with storyboards as a child, a comic book look that is produced giving the director a visualization of what the film will look like. The trouble with The Aviator, it looks like a storyboard. The replicas and animation of Hugh's weird airplanes almost steal the show, because they are the only interesting thing to look at on screen. Howard Hughes is never fleshed out. At least Kinsey, a recent bio flick tried to show why Kinsey was what he was, but DiCaprio's Hugh's is some kind of freak because his mother talked about diseases while he bathed. There's not enough there Martin. The bulk of the film shows a very young actor with no physical resemblance to Howard Hughes talking big time business and avionics without any back-story on how he became so brilliant out of the crib? The women in Hugh's life are trotted out one by one. He's a cocky guy putting his hand under a cigarette flappers skirt, a rich boy lover for Kathryn Hepburn (She doesn't come off too swell in this version), and Ava Gardner (No wonder Sinatra and Artie Shaw had it easy with this chick after the money-bags geekdom of Hughes).

When it doesn't work out they stay with their snake-loving uncle (Billy Connolly) and, later, their fear-plagued aunt (Meryl Streep). Emily Browning plays the inventive 14 year-old and Liam Aiken her exceptionally intelligent brother. Jude Law is on hand as the narrator Lemony Snicket.This is akin to a modern-day \"Wizard of Oz\" (1939) and is similar in tone to \"Into the Woods\" (2014), albeit without the constant songs. Carrey is effective as the creepy and malevolent Count Olaf. His performance is fittingly over-the-top and amusing in a black humor way. His mansion looks like it was designed & furnished by the Addams Family. Emily Browning shines as the winsome adolescent with an unbelievably cute face. She was 15 during shooting.People have criticized the film on the grounds that the adults repeatedly refuse to believe the children, who are always cognizant of Olaf's diabolical doings, but it smacks of real life.

The comic timing is great, the action sequences fill you with energy, and of course the acting is good. The director deserves a round of applause.What I like the most about this film is - it is \"Asgardian\" film. The setting makes you feel like you are watching a Thor film, completely detached from influences from Earth (even though Dr. Strange is there for some few minutes).But with all this said, Ragnarok is still missing that 'conflict' and 'resolution' balance that otherwise all MCU films had (except perhaps Spiderman: Homecoming. That film was bad).The conflict between Thor and Hela is more of who-threatens-who more rather than who is fighting whom. She is a menacing villain, I agree, but her intentions aren't clear. She is freed from her prison and hopes to win over Asgard. Why does she, then, wait for such a long time to do so? Was Heimdall her worthy adversary then? Or, was she simply waiting Thor's return? What was stopping her from causing havoc\/Ragnarok of her own? Also, (SPOILERS AHEAD) when Thor realizes Ragnarok is bound to happen, why does Hela try to save Asgard? Did she not realize that \"Asgard is its people?\" Seems like she was closer to Odin than Thor ever was (she was his 'executioner' for crying out loud!)Technically and via its story, Thor is the best in its own series. Seeing the funnier side of Hulk, and the eye-candy Mr. Goldblum was just too satisfying. But the end battle and sequences, the justification of the film's ending, motif of Hela, and obviously motif of Loki is somewhat misleading and\/or not defined properly.I rate this film 7\/10.

It has everything that any great movie would have: car chases, corruption--oh you can't forget--a smoke hot Daisy Duke! If you haven't figured it out already, I am talking about the Dukes of Hazard. This movie is one of my all time favorite movies. It really keeps me interested all the way through. Being that is was a TV show before it hit the movie theaters, I think is part of the reason that is has been a favorite among many people.The movie starts having Bo (Seann Scoot) and Luke (Johnny Knoxville) Duke being chased by the town sheriff Roscoe P. Coltrane (M.C. Gainey) for running moonshine. The moonshine is made by Uncle Jesse (Willie Nelson). The chase is one of the typical Dukes of Hazard chases. They slide round the corners in their 1969 dodge charger called the General Lee, then jump a creak to get away from the cops, but when landing they wedge the car in-between two tractors, breaking all the jars of moonshine. This is a great opening and is very fitting for this movie--it grabs your attention!Now, if you don't already know, the Duke boys are always in trouble with the law. I guess running moonshine will do that to a feller. So when the county commissioner Boss Hog want to evict the Dukes from their farm in the hazard swamps, it comes with no surprise: \"what is he going to do with the farm?\" The Dukes must find out what Boss Hog's plans for the farm is and spoil them so they can get their farm back. So they head to Atlanta to meet up with an old friend and to go over some core samples that the found in the office of Boss Hog and realize that they are coal. Realizing that Boss Hog is probably going to turn the farm along with the rest of the county into a giant coal mine, they race back to Hazzard.Now, it would not be fitting to tell you the rest of the story. That would spoil the whole film. You will have to go and find out for yourself. Do the Dukes save Hazard or is it too late? I will tell you one thing: it is worth going and seeing.","rating":10,"review_summary":"Dukes Save Hazzard","cleaned_review_text":"great american movi whole famili enjoy everyth great movi would car chase corruptionoh cant forgeta smoke hot daisi duke havent figur alreadi talk duke hazard movi one time favorit movi realli keep interest way tv show hit movi theater think part reason favorit among mani peopleth movi start bo seann scoot luke johnni knoxvil duke chase town sheriff rosco p coltran mc gainey run moonshin moonshin made uncl jess willi nelson chase one typic duke hazard chase slide round corner dodg charger call gener lee jump creak get away cop land wedg car inbetween two tractor break jar moonshin great open fit movieit grab attentionnow dont alreadi know duke boy alway troubl law guess run moonshin feller counti commission boss hog want evict duke farm hazard swamp come surpris go farm duke must find boss hog plan farm spoil get farm back head atlanta meet old friend go core sampl found offic boss hog realiz coal realiz boss hog probabl go turn farm along rest counti giant coal mine race back hazzardnow would fit tell rest stori would spoil whole film go find duke save hazard late tell one thing worth go see","label":0}

I don't care if it was made for kids; it is excrement. Let's go through this travesty, shall we?1) Wow, I was not aware that apparently owls EAT such animals as cats and pigs! No, you've really seen it all when you see a pig scared of being eaten by an owl. Wouldn't it have made more sense if the villains had been hawks or vultures? Okay, then they wouldn't have hated the sun so much, but having owls wanting to eat pigs doesn't make any more sense!2) Story logic: Everyone believes Chanticleer makes the sun rise every morning, but then they see it come up without him, so they think he's a fraud. But then it turns out it DOESN'T rise without him. So what the hell? Why did the sun come up without him that one time? Is it able to come up by itself a single time, but then needs him to continuously do so? I saw this movie when I was 7, and was confused by that.3) Okay, so the sun can't come up and it's always night; why does that make it rain and flood as well?4) The live-action scenes are shot so terribly! Seriously, they look like a bad home movie.5) Edmond can't act, but if you think about it; his entire storyline is really unnecessary. You could just cut him out, cut out all the live-action stuff, told the whole movie as just a straight cartoon, and still have the same story.6) With all respect to Phil Harris and his long resume of animated voice work, I think he's one of the most annoying narrators in film history. \"Well, shucks. Just imagine if one day the sun just didn't come up, but went back down.\" Then he just KEEPS ON TALKING, sometimes over very dramatic scenes.Patou: (narrating) If Edmond wanted to bring Chanticleer back to raise the sun, the Duke was going to have something to say about it. Grand Duke: Kittens are more digestible. Patou: (narrating) Young Edmond was about to have the most amazing adventure he'd ever dreamed of.Just SHUT UP! You don't need to tell us that the Duke is mad, we can see that. You don't need to tell us that Edmond is about to go on an adventure. Just let us enjoy the movie!!7) The climax: after going on this \"amazing adventure,\" it all comes down to a stupid climax of convincing Chanticleer to crow, but he doesn't feel like it. So they chant his name over and over until he feels like it. Couldn't they have come up with something more dramatic than that?8) And what does his crowing do? Make the Duke shrink. I don't quite understand that logic.So in conclusion, the story is badly conceived, the execution is even worse, and the result is a mess of a movie.","rating":1,"review_summary":"One of the Worst Films of All Time","cleaned_review_text":"one worst movi ever made dont care made kid excrement let go travesti shall wow awar appar owl eat anim cat pig youv realli seen see pig scare eaten owl wouldnt made sens villain hawk vultur okay wouldnt hate sun much owl want eat pig doesnt make sens stori logic everyon believ chanticl make sun rise everi morn see come without think he fraud turn doesnt rise without hell sun come without one time abl come singl time need continu saw movi confus okay sun cant come alway night make rain flood well liveact scene shot terribl serious look like bad home movi edmond cant act think entir storylin realli unnecessari could cut cut liveact stuff told whole movi straight cartoon still stori respect phil harri long resum anim voic work think he one annoy narrat film histori well shuck imagin one day sun didnt come went back keep talk sometim dramat scenespat narrat edmond want bring chanticl back rais sun duke go someth say grand duke kitten digest patou narrat young edmond amaz adventur hed ever dream ofjust shut dont need tell us duke mad see dont need tell us edmond go adventur let us enjoy movi climax go amaz adventur come stupid climax convinc chanticl crow doesnt feel like chant name feel like couldnt come someth dramat crow make duke shrink dont quit understand logicso conclus stori badli conceiv execut even wors result mess movi","label":1}

Religion is all about faith in greater god (\"The Father\") without questioning his commands, while your natural pulses - like lust -> sex - are forbidden or suppressed. The only difference I imagine is, that Religion does indoctrination for economic advantages , where as in the move all this happened in the case of a greater good - the war and cruelty free society. So second: What does the move what to tell?Suppression, blindness and faith doesn't create a greater world, even if its done in a selfless way. Life is about feelings - the ups and downs make life worth; how could you know how much happiness if worth, if you don't know his opposite Anger and Sadness.

{"review_date":"5 August 2011","movie_id":"tt0032553","user_id":"ur17036730","is_spoiler":true,"review_text":"Charles Chaplin stars, directs, produces, and writes the score in one of his greatest movies since The Kid(1921). It's the story of an absent-minded, but mild-manner Jewish barber(Charles Chaplin) and a ruthless dictator named Adenoid Hynkel(also Charles Chaplin). What do these two have in common? They look exactly like each other! Talk about a case of mistaken identity. Like all the Jewish people during WWII, the Jewish barber was a victim of discrimination and was forced to live in a ghetto. Watch the comic scenes where the Jewish barber dances to the tune of Brahm's Hungarian Dance No. 5 while working at his barbershop, where Hynkel takes off Field Marshall Herring's(Billy Gilbert, who worked for the Three Stooges and Laurel & Hardy) many badges, and the comical dinner fight with Hynkel and Napaloni(Jack Oakie) and stay tuned for the most powerful speech delivered by the Jewish Barber since MLK's \"I Have A Dream\". The movie is a satire of Germany during WWII and Adenoid Hynkel was based on the infamous dictator of Germany, Adolf Hitler. This movie also stars Paulette Goddard as the beautiful Hannah and Reginald Gardiner as Commander Shultz. \"The Great Dictator\" is one movie you'll watch again and again! 10 Million stars out of ten.","rating":10,"review_summary":"A Comical, yet Powerful Movie starring Charles Chaplin","cleaned_review_text":"charl chaplin star direct produc write score one greatest movi sinc kid stori absentmind mildmann jewish barbercharl chaplin ruthless dictat name adenoid hynkelalso charl chaplin two common look exactli like talk case mistaken ident like jewish peopl wwii jewish barber victim discrimin forc live ghetto watch comic scene jewish barber danc tune brahm hungarian danc work barbershop hynkel take field marshal herringsbilli gilbert work three stoog laurel hardi mani badg comic dinner fight hynkel napalonijack oaki stay tune power speech deliv jewish barber sinc mlk dream movi satir germani wwii adenoid hynkel base infam dictat germani adolf hitler movi also star paulett goddard beauti hannah reginald gardin command shultz great dictat one movi youll watch million star ten","label":1}

Its like watching a movie about a McDonalds fry cook trying to move up to running a cash register. And how he misses his days at Burger King. No sex. No comedy. No killing. No car chases. NOTHING. A complete waste of time. What idiots voted this movie for an academy award? Other actors of course. Who cares.Aren't movies supposed to be interesting?Anything on the Discovery Channel, History Channel, or Golf, or Wrestling is way more interesting. Watching my dog sleep is more interesting that this waste of time. I watched the whole thing and I don't understand what happened at the end. Nothing ironic, nothing surprising. I waited the whole movie for something interesting to happen, the best part was the advertisements before the movie.","rating":1,"review_summary":"Boring nonsense","cleaned_review_text":"noth interest noth funni bad movi bad actor life like watch movi mcdonald fri cook tri move run cash regist miss day burger king sex comedi kill car chase noth complet wast time idiot vote movi academi award actor cours caresar movi suppos interestinganyth discoveri channel histori channel golf wrestl way interest watch dog sleep interest wast time watch whole thing dont understand happen end noth iron noth surpris wait whole movi someth interest happen best part advertis movi","label":0}

This is definitely not the best Lethal Weapon movie ever, although Joe Pesci as Leo Getz stars as the best character. I had this feeling that the writers were searching for a good start and end. After the opening scene, the guy with the flame-thrower, it took too long to see new action. Too less action, enough humor and too sentimental. When you love action, humor and a high grade, go see it. When you like a good combination of those elements, skip it.","rating":7,"review_summary":"Keep this book closed.","cleaned_review_text":"final definit best lethal weapon movi ever although joe pesci leo getz star best charact feel writer search good start end open scene guy flamethrow took long see new action less action enough humor sentiment love action humor high grade go see like good combin element skip","label":0}
{"review_date":"11 September 2008","movie_id":"tt0887883","user_id":"ur10829971","is_spoiler":false,"review_text":"Without a doubt, Burn After Reading is one of the best movies The Coen Brothers have ever made. I say one of the best because it's hard to compare an out of control serious comedy like this, to something like No Country for Old Men.The film is brilliant in every single aspect: the story, the characters, the actors, everything! Especially for those that haven't seen something like this before: it's so worth it! On one hand you have George Clooney taking his acting skills to whole new areas especially after he just made some awesome movies like Syrannia, Michael Clayton, and Leatherheads, Frances Mcdormand playing a total pessimist, John Malkovitch stealing every scene simply by his reactions to everything,he kind of reminded me of the character \"Seth\" from Superbad, only way older, smarter, and a bit thinner. Tilda Swinton's right where she should be playing the \"cold-hard bitch\", much like her recent roles in Narnia and Clayton. And Brad Pitt, whose role in the movie made me laugh almost every second he was on screen, it was something he's never done before, but that's what made it so perfect! Above all, the movie is almost flawless, it's kind of hard to find a perfect comedy out there, but this one had almost everything work out for it. Whether or not you like the Coen brothers, or even if you didn't like No Country for Old Men, Burn After Reading is the perfect comedy for those that truly believe:, \"Intelligence is relative\". Good job Joel and Ethan! 10\/10","rating":9,"review_summary":"The Coen's brothers in their prime!","cleaned_review_text":"without doubt burn read one best movi coen brother ever made say one best hard compar control seriou comedi like someth like countri old menth film brilliant everi singl aspect stori charact actor everyth especi havent seen someth like worth one hand georg clooney take act skill whole new area especi made awesom movi like syrannia michael clayton leatherhead franc mcdormand play total pessimist john malkovitch steal everi scene simpli reaction everythingh kind remind charact seth superbad way older smarter bit thinner tilda swinton right play coldhard bitch much like recent role narnia clayton brad pitt whose role movi made laugh almost everi second screen someth he never done that made perfect movi almost flawless kind hard find perfect comedi one almost everyth work whether like coen brother even didnt like countri old men burn read perfect comedi truli believ intellig rel good job joel ethan","label":0}
