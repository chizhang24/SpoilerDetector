INMAS Workshop 4 Project


(Possible)Downstream tasks

1. prediction of spoiler label (Siqi Jiao, Sunny Zhao)
2. Classification
3. Howard: a bare minimum is to create a classifier model that uses movie ratings to predict genres as a training set, and apply it to predict genres based on ratings for anime as a testing set. A more ambitious but time permitting idea is assessing movie ratings depending on if there are characters that use fire in them, hoping to use NLP and perhaps chatbots to more accurately attain information on whether or not a certain movie has a character that uses fire in it
